&quot;Throughout the year as you send cards and special letters to the people you love, do you secretly wish someone would send you such heartfelt words? Do you crave to hear loving words said to you and about you? Well today you are going to have the opportunity to receive such a letter. Today you are going to write yourself a glorious, wonderful, caring, love-filled love letter! You have this special time to set all your worries aside, let all your cares slip away, and tell yourself all the words you long to hear.<p>First get in the mood by noticing your surroundings. If it&#39;s possible, light a candle or some incense. Make yourself your favorite cup of tea or some hot chocolate. Just get real cozy and put on some soothing music. Have your favorite pen ready with some pretty stationery or paper.</p><p>Now that you are all set, it&#39;s time to prepare your mind.... Sit back and relax, take a deep breath and just close your eyes for a few minutes, smell the incense or your hot chocolate and just feel yourself relaxing.</p><p>After a few minutes open your eyes and begin to write a sincere letter of love to yourself. (Set a timer if it helps you feel free to go for it.) Go ahead and write down everything you love about yourself. Appreciate all your little idiosyncrasies, your pet peeves, your values, how you stand up for yourself. Your goals, your dreams, your caring personality, your beautiful smile, how you always wear blue on Thursday, etc. Just let the words flow, loving and appreciating everything about you. </p><p>Wow, didn&#39;t that feel great? Now, if you are doing this workshop by yourself, I want you to read the letter out loud to yourself while looking into a mirror and make eye contact with yourself while you read! If you are with a friend or in a group then have everyone hold hands while one person at a time reads their letter out loud for everyone to hear. Be bold and courageous, sing your praises loudly!&quot;</p><p><br />Supplies needed:<br />Special writing paper, pens, timer, soft music, incense, flowers, tea or hot chocolate and/or candles</p><br />

&quot;Fabi and I introduced the Women&rsquo;s Windows program at Chicana Service Action Center in October, 2003. It has been a remarkable time for both of us. It&rsquo;s been amazing to see how the participants have used the idea of shapes, colors, pen, and paper to express their personal pains, frustrations, insecurities, love, and accomplishments. <br /><br />Most women have learned to perceive the Windows Program as a powerful medium to confront their fears, insecurities, and fragmented identities. This &lsquo;window of time&rsquo; has also served as a safe place to relax and blaze a path for their future. <br /><br />The women are rapidly becoming confortable and at ease with the windows art process. They enjoy the fact that it is a non-judgemental, voluntary and free art process. I think that is what they most enjoy about the art program. Since they know that no one is going to judge their work, (they don&rsquo;t have to share if they don&rsquo;t want to), they really become comfortable and at ease with their own selves.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />

<![CDATA[
&ldquo;At Sexual Assault Crisis Agency (SACA), we presented our very first Windows workshop in January. We&rsquo;ve been so excited to bring this program to survivors of sexual violence, and it was a powerful first night. All six of the women who attended the first group had been sexually abused as children, and many had had multiple experiences of sexual assault and domestic violence. During the opening circle, half of the women expressed both that they were uncomfortable with art, and that they were feeling some intense anxiety about being in the group at all. After a relaxation exercise, the women started working on their tunnel books. It was amazing to see how absorbed each of them became in the project, and when the time came to finish up, they all wanted to continue working on their creations. Each woman had used the project in such a creative way to express her feelings. <br /><br />The first lesson we learned is that we need to allow plenty of extra time during every session not only for women to share their art, but also to have a second closing circle for women to reflect on something positive that they can take away from the session, or a special way that they can take care of themselves after group. Women healing from child sexual abuse have often experienced many layers of trauma, and the feelings that they have been living with for decades run deep. When inviting women to explore those feelings, we know that there is no way to keep it &#39;light,&#39; and we need to spend more time on closure so that the experience, however painful, is also healing. <br /><br />In our traditional &#39;talking&#39; counseling groups, it usually takes weeks and weeks of careful work by both the facilitators and the participants to create an environment where survivors feel safe enough to open up to each other. For women in our Windows group to be talking out loud about being ritually abused, molested, raped, and battered in front of women they have never seen before is a testament to the incredible power of creative expression. <br /><br />At the close of our second Windows group, we were inspired to hear all of the ten women present (including all six who had come to the first group) share that listening to each other had made them realize that they were not crazy, they were not alone, they could use their voices, and they could find hope. <br /><br />We believe that the art program will have a dramatic impact on speeding up the healing process for women. Thanks AWBW for supporting us in bringing this amazing program to sexual assault survivors!&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />

&ldquo;We have seen a lot of change with the younger group of children. At first they weren&rsquo;t familiar with the art materials and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed seeing how comfortable they&rsquo;ve become with everything &mdash; paints, crayons, glue, even feathers. They are more confident expressing themselves through art. They&rsquo;re focused and understand that this is their special time... a unique experience, aside from what they have to do at the shelter. <br /><br />One girl started the art workshops when she was one-and-a-half years old. Since she was so young, it was hard for her to actually focus for the whole art time. At first we started with ten minutes, but now she can do the whole group &mdash; even the story part in the beginning. It&rsquo;s so nice to see her have something stable in her life and be able to express herself. <br /><br />The art really allows the children to be free. When they focus and see the finished product I feel that they have released some great feeling they didn&rsquo;t even know existed.&quot;

&ldquo;We were working on Tunnel Books and one of the teen girls was struggling with the project. She had cut out a lot of different eyes, but it seemed like the Tunnel Book idea just wasn&rsquo;t working for her. I told her just to go ahead and do whatever came to her. <br /><br />&ldquo;It turns out that in coming to stay at our agency, she had felt completely betrayed by the mandatory reporting. She was feeling that she couldn&rsquo;t open up to a counselor. <br /><br />&ldquo;As she created her art, she was able to find a way to open up. All the eyes represented different feelings she was going through as she was dealing with an attempted rape. She wrote a powerful poem illustrated by all the different eyes. The art gave her a safe way to explore it and talk about what she was going through.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

&quot;Before I attended the AWBW training, I was working with the children without the Windows program. After working one-on-one with a three-year-old client I felt moved to try something new and look into the program. <p>I tried leading the Helping Hands workshop (September 2002 Update). The girl traced her hands and colored them in with different colors. When I asked her to share about her artwork, she explained that one of her hand drawings meant she has caring hands to touch her mommy to comfort her, and another hand drawing she did meant that she could use her hands to be helpful to her mom with chores at the shelter. </p><p>Listening to her share about her hands, I could tell that she was seeing her hands in a new way because of the project. She would never see her hands in the same way again. I was so inspired by her! </p><p>Now I&#39;ve attended the Children&#39;s Windows Training and look forward to continuing to use the art as a unique opportunity for the children to explore and express themselves.&quot; <br /></p><br />

&quot;It was about five and a half years ago that I participated in the Children&#39;s Windows Training, and I still feel so fortunate to this day. <p>Getting to &lsquo;be a kid again&#39; at the training and exploring art with such safety and support completely transformed the way I work with the children. Remembering how I felt as a child enables me to connect with the children at their level, both physically and emotionally. I feel the impact of the Windows program in everything I do with the children.</p><p>Having that special &lsquo;window of time&#39; at the AWBW training is very rare for shelter staff and there&#39;s a major change that happens inside of you. </p><p>I just sent a staff member to the recent training and I already see a lot of change in her. I see her listening to the children and enjoying them in new ways. She really understands how they talk through their art without saying a word. And then they begin to open up and share words about what their art means to them. We sometimes look at each other with such amazement at what the children say or do during their Windows time.&quot; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&ldquo;I had a client that came into shelter with a small boy and a baby on a special heart monitor. The client had supposedly been clean for 6 months, but she hardly communicated with us, slept a lot, and we figured that she was just coming down from speed. <br /><br />She barely followed the program and during case management, we had decided that she needed to exit because she was not benefiting from the program. <br /><br />Then we had a Friday meeting &mdash; our special AWBW day. For weeks she had said &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have anything I want to say,&rsquo; and this day looked as if it would be the same. But this time she said &lsquo;I want to share!&rsquo; <br /><br />It seemed like someone had waved a magic wand over her, and from that time forward, she started to work her program like she really wanted to make a difference in her life. It seemed like AWBW suddenly had made her realize that she could accomplish any goal that she set her mind to do.<br /><br />Her picture was a beautiful ocean scene, but when she explained it to all of us, it was Jesus&rsquo; light shining down and covering her and her children while they healed. There was not a dry eye in the group that day!<br /><br />Needless to say, she worked her program great after that, and later that year I got an update from her: Both children were healthy, the baby was ready to walk and she was off the heart monitor. Her little boy was thriving and growing and excelling in pre-school. She was working and going to school part-time. She was meeting her goals and going forward in life. She had not relapsed with drugs or an abusive mate. She was making a difference in the community and in her children&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />

&quot;In the shelter it sometimes goes in cycles and we get a whole wave of new clients in. Just recently I had a new group and they all were rolling their eyes at the beginning of the Windows group, hesitant to get started, hesitant about the art supplies, resistant to everything. <p>The project we were doing was called Crayon Feelings, and as they did the project, they were so resistant. I thought for sure when we reached the end of it, it would be like &lsquo;Okay, Bye!&#39; and they&#39;d be out the door, but it turned out they had gotten a lot out of it and they talked up a storm! </p><p>It really amazed me - because they were all so new, they hardly knew each other, and all of the sudden they were opening up about everything. </p><p>It&#39;s amazing the safety and connection art can make possible!&quot;</p><br />

&ldquo;When I was getting ready to lead the &#39;Seeing Me&#39; workshop with the mirrors, I felt conflicted. I have a hard time seeing the beauty in myself, and I thought &lsquo;If I can&rsquo;t see my own beauty, how am I going to lead this with the ladies?&rsquo; Then I remembered the words to the song &lsquo;I Am Beautiful&rsquo; by Christina Aguilera. It helped so much! I decided to pass out the lyrics at the beginning of the group and the women loved it. It helped ALL of us feel stronger and more able to see the beauty in ourselves. Here are the lyrics (attached), so you can use them too!&rdquo; <span class="EmailHeader"><br /><br />Beautiful</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">by Christina Aguilera </span><br /><br />Spoken <br />Don&#39;t look at me<br /><br />Every day is so wonderful<br />And suddenly, it&#39;s hard to breathe<br />Now and then, I get insecure<br />From all the fame, I&#39;m so ashamed<br /><br />I am beautiful no matter what they say<br />Words can&#39;t bring me down<br />I am beautiful in every single way<br />Yes, words can&#39;t bring me down<br />So don&#39;t you bring me down today<br /><br />To all your friends, you&#39;re delirious<br />So consumed in all your doom<br />Trying hard to fill the emptiness<br />The piece is gone and the puzzle undone<br />That&#39;s the way it is<br /><br />You are beautiful no matter what they say<br />Words won&#39;t bring you down<br />You are beautiful in every single way<br />Yes, words won&#39;t bring you down<br />Don&#39;t you bring me down today...<br /><br />No matter what we do <br />(no matter what we do)<br />No matter what they say <br />(no matter what they say)<br />When the sun is shining through<br />Then the clouds won&#39;t stay<br /><br />And everywhere we go <br />(everywhere we go)<br />The sun won&#39;t always shine <br />(sun won&#39;t always shine)<br />But tomorrow will find a way <br />All the other times<br /><br />We are beautiful no matter what they say<br />Yes, words won&#39;t bring us down<br />We are beautiful no matter what they say<br />Yes, words can&#39;t bring us down<br />Don&#39;t you bring me down today<br /><br />Don&#39;t you bring me down today<br />Don&#39;t you bring me down today <br />

&quot;Recently when I was working with a group that was getting ready to leave the shelter, we did the Survival Masks project (February 2000). <p>Most of the women chose to split the face on the mask. They created one side to represent what they came to the shelter as and the other side to represent what they were leaving with. </p><p>It was incredibly powerful for the women to actually see the difference and acknowledge their growth. It was fascinating for all of us to see their change so clearly. </p><p>When the women left the shelter they very carefully packed their art work between their clothing, so they could keep it protected!&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;I owe a great deal to my AWBW leader, Lucy. She opened my eyes to the healing power of art and the value of my own work. And without her I would never have become a Windows leader myself. <p>As a leader, I&#39;m just delighted. I&#39;m learning to enjoy the moment and appreciate what women get out of each session. They have fun. They get to leave the shelter and spend time in a nice quiet place. We make sure that they are treated in a special way, to rebuild their sense of self-worth. The Windows time is much more than just doing a workshop.</p><p>Being a part of the Windows network is extremely important to me. Being connected to a larger whole matters. It keeps me from being isolated. It enables me to see this work as something much larger and more important than can be done by one person alone.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&ldquo;That day, the workshop was collaging.

She said, &lsquo;I am just like that little frog. Each leap is very difficult, but I am going to make it.&rsquo; <br /><br />This story stays with me forever, and I share it whenever possible at my presentations and cultural training.<br /><br />AWBW is a very powerful tool. You help them heal, and create a dream and hope for the future. I thank you for such a creative program.&rdquo;<br /><br />

&ldquo;When they leave the shelter, clients fill out a program evaluation of their entire experience at the shelter. I&rsquo;ve noticed clients frequently write that the art was the most helpful and the most healing.<br /><br />The class spills over and they take it with them to other parts of their shelter life. It&rsquo;s like rediscovering a valuable tool to heal from post-traumatic stress disorder and it&rsquo;s something they can do own their own. They say that they had forgotten how relaxing art can be, and often the workshops become a springboard to do art on their own. <br /><br />Some clients have started journaling on their own and many like to take it home to do art with their children. One client has even become an activist in the community using her poetry as outreach.&rdquo;<br /><br />

&quot;Several women who were about to leave the shelter stayed because of the way the art helped them find safety and understanding. <br /><br />One woman was thinking of leaving because she felt misunderstood. But when she stayed for an art group, the creative process helped her realize that she actually finds it hard to understand her own self. After that, she felt more connected to the shelter and was able to stay and receive support. Another client found it difficult to feel like she could trust anyone. Through the art group, she was able to express and then feel in control of her own decisions on what she did and did not want to share. The art gave her a gentle bridge between her heart and the shelter staff. <br /><br />We just started the Women&rsquo;s Windows Program and have already found that the art enables us to reach our clients in special ways. We love the Women&rsquo;s Windows so much, we are now working on raising support to start the Children&rsquo;s Windows Program too.&rdquo;<br /><br />

&ldquo;When clients come to the shelter they often don&rsquo;t feel good about themselves. They have been made to feel they are worthless, and their self-esteem is so low. <br /><br />One client coming to the Windows group for the first time was so nervous she started to cry. You could see in her eyes that she felt like she couldn&rsquo;t create because she felt so <br />badly about herself. <br /><br />I decided to take her outside so I could talk to her one-on-one. I took about ten minutes to reassure her that her feelings were normal and that it&rsquo;s okay to feel that way. <br /><br />We went back inside and by the end of the group she was smiling and happy. She even said, &lsquo;I really enjoyed making this rose&hellip; keeping my hands busy helped release some anxiety. Thank You. My pink rose is really pretty and so is my face!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br /><br />

&ldquo;Alice is a young lady who was sexually abused as a child by her dad. She felt that guys during grade school and high school only used her for sex. Alice was quiet and displayed poor self-esteem. She left and returned to the shelter twice. <br /><br />I was able to connect with Alice through art. She said that she had never had a good feeling about herself or her life. But she reported that art made her feel happy, and she would like to open up a shop with her creations: jewelry and treasure boxes. <br /><br />She was amazed that she was so creative!&rdquo;<br /><br />

&quot;In October 2003 we had our first exhibit at The Women&#39;s Community. Over thirty beautiful &quot;Hand Mandalas&quot; adorned the walls (see Leader&#39;s Update, March 2004). In April 2004, we held the &quot;Take a Walk in My Shoes&quot; exhibit at the Center for Visual Arts (August 2004 Update). There, people told me they cried while looking at those shoes and the words that helped tell the stories. <p>One woman told me she had a dear friend who had been raped as a young adult. She had tried to understand her pain, but never really could until she saw the shoes. </p><p>She immediately left and brought her friend back and together they mourned. </p><p>&quot;Some things just can&#39;t be talked about. That is why we have art.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;The Life Line workshop (July 2005) really allowed the ladies to go in the direction they needed to go and to tap into feelings that were buried.<br /><p>One of the group participants created a diary about her abusive relationship. The diary began with the first incident of physical abuse since her first incident of physical abuse stemmed from her batterer finding her diary. Her husband took the diary, tore it into shreds and threw it out of a car window. As a result of the traumatic event she hadn&#39;t kept a diary until this project. She was happy to reclaim her own personal writing space that had been so violently taken from her.<br /><br />Another participant shared that this project allowed her to discover patterns of abuse in her life. She had not dealt with the abuse she suffered at the hands of her parents and how it may have affected subsequent relationships.&quot;<br /></p><br />

&quot;Last month I did the Letter to Abuser workshop. I was unsure if I should use such a deep workshop for new participants. <p>There was one resident who painted &lsquo;thank you&#39; on the back of her letter. During sharing the client stated that she wanted to thank her abuser, because she believed that everything happens for reason. </p><p>She stated that if he hadn&#39;t been a part of her life she may have never learned to get help and see all the positive things. </p><p>I found this incredible that she found something so positive could come out of such a horrible situation.&quot; <br /></p><br />

After the project, one of the teen moms who had been very dependent on her boyfriend said, &lsquo;Never have a baby because you are lonely.&#39; This was a major moment of self-awareness for her.</p><p>It made me smile recently when one new girl told me she had heard about the Windows groups and she was looking forward to it because it would give her a break from &lsquo;having&#39; to talk about feelings - but little did she know, they talk about feelings all the time through their art!&quot;<br /></p><br />

&quot;During this workshop, for some reason this little girl couldn&#39;t get started. She was so afraid. She&#39;s shy and quiet but usually feels comfortable here. She said, &quot;I can&#39;t get started, Miss Julie, I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; <p>I said, &#39;Just try to start drawing and the rest will start coming to you. Can you try that?&#39; She began drawing, and totally tuned all of us out. It was like she was in a time warp all of her own, she didn&#39;t talk, she didn&#39;t look around. She stayed bent over her work and drew and drew and drew. Her picture was so detailed! So many tiny areas! The entire page was filled up with her things. She made a full body monster. She declined to share with the group, and was sad during the discussion.</p><p>When I asked her what her picture meant. She told me about the teasing at school, especially from boys and about the part of her dad she doesn&#39;t like. </p><p>I asked her if I could put it up, and she said I could only put it up if it was really high up where no one could see it.</p><p>She let out so much, it was really amazing!&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;With the Inside/Outside Workshop, the children talked about how they feel, and some shared how they thought mom or someone else feels they should feel. <p>I loved seeing them able to reach out inside and were able to really discuss all of their feelings. These were some of their comments:</p><p>&quot;Sometimes I feel sad but my mom thinks everything is fine.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I hide how I feel because I think no one will understand me or nothing will change.&quot; </p><p>&quot;If no one knows how I feel, I can feel safe with my feelings.&quot;</p><p>It was rewarding to see them being so non-judgemental towards each other. They were able to work with their feelings of sadness, anger and hurt, and they had the power to voice their thoughts. Through the art, they were able to work on their creativity and produce positive feelings and this showed in their work. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

We encourage them, reminding them that &lsquo;all is okay&#39; when creating.&quot; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;This workshop was truly amazing and exciting to lead. Currently at Lydia Place we have a handful of toddlers and several of them are boys. Also, the theme in our house with these 4-5 year old boys is &quot;superheroes,&quot; so I knew the life-sized shields would go over well. As a leader I always have high hopes that each &quot;windows&quot; will touch the lives of these children. <p>This workshop did wonders for this five-year-old boy. His mom was talking to him about his shield and what the pictures and words represented. A picture of a woman statue, kneeling down, holding up the world was supposed to be her. As he was telling her this he started to cry and so did his mom. He saw his mom trying to carry the world on her shoulders for him and his sister. This is coming from a boy who is outgoing, but very shy when you ask him what he&#39;s thinking or feeling. As a leader this touched my heart. Sometimes I get to be a part of hearing the children tell their moms about their art and sometimes I don&#39;t. Knowing that leading the &quot;windows&quot; really does reach these children makes my job all the more worth while.&quot; <br /></p><br />

As she did art she seemed happier and less sullen. <p>As she got to do art in the Windows group, she realized that the art she did was important and that it felt good. I think that this helped her in her art class at school too. </p><p>Her first good grade at her new school was in art.

&quot;AWBW has given me the opportunity to expand my personal point of view. When I&#8200;went to the training, the workshops inspired me and opened up doors of healing that had been closed for a long time. I was able to deal with things that I didn&#39;t even know existed in myself after 20 years of hurt and low self-esteem.<p>Through that experience, the training equipped me to look at not only the circumstances of a child, but the core and soul and specific needs of that child. </p><p>It made me realize we really need to make it possible for each child to be an individual - expressing him or herself through art. When the doors of creativity are opened, it is so important what comes through those doors. As I work with the children, I see that they are able to express things that they might not want to share with their moms - especially feelings of missing their fathers. The artwork gives them a chance to be themselves.&quot; </p><p>-Katrina Lewis</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;Over the summer I was given more responsibilities and more groups to lead. My schedule got really busy, and the same thing was happening with other staff. <p>I noticed the Windows groups getting squeezed out of the schedule, and I couldn&#39;t stand the women being denied something that brings them so much joy and discovery. </p><p>I pictured how they stand around in the courtyard after their Windows time, sharing what they&#39;ve created and what it means to them. </p><p>I decided I would fight for their Windows time and shared my thoughts with my supervisor. I told her I had to see the Windows time continue, no matter what. She asked what I needed and I said a consistent weekly time and childcare for the women&#39;s kids. She said Tuesday afternoons, and that&#39;s how it&#39;s been ever since. </p><p>It feels so good to see it happening again. The Windows time means so much to the women each week. It&#39;s deeply moving to see what the women create and all they gain from it!&quot;<br /></p><br />

We&#39;re going to do Windows.&#39; <p>We did Monster in Me. I asked her to draw the monster she feels like when she&#39;s angry. At first she said she didn&#39;t want to, but pretty soon she got into it. She drew a pretty monster with make-up on. Her monster was so mad it was pulling its hair out. </p><p>Afterwards my daughter felt much better. She put her monster on the refrigerator and later I heard her laughing on the phone, telling her friends about it. It brought us closer together and gave her a way to deal with the anger she feels as a teenager. </p><p>Everyone notices her monster when they come over to our house. My daughter tells her friends they should try it too. Now I&#39;m thinking of leading Monster in Me for a group of them!&quot;</p><br />

&quot;I think my favorite moments as a leader are when I see a child open up. A child will start the AWBW group shy and timid but then they build up trust and start to open up to you - these are all my favorite moments as a leader.<p>I had a client, an 11 year old boy. He came in with black circles under his eyes and wouldn&#39;t talk at first. When he opened up he told me that that he would not sleep at night for fear that something would happen to his mama. He was staying up so that if he could protect his mother if he needed to, so when he was able to just be a child and express himself through art, it was very special and touching. It was the art workshop that made the difference.</p><p>AWBW gives you the opportunity to lead a project any way you can and gives us flexibility, making it easy and rewarding for the kids to participate.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;I have been away from the Children&#39;s Windows Program for a year and when I returned I was reminded of how much the program and working with the children means to me. <p>I used the Family Footprints project (January 2002 Update) and adapted it to a group of boys from 8 to 12 years old. I traced around each of their feet on file folder paper so that one foot could represent &quot;where I have been&quot; and the other foot &quot;where I want to go.&quot; The boys then cut out their feet and any images that pleased them. </p><p>The youngest boy was delighted with the materials, especially glitter glue. The next to the youngest was the most quiet and reflective but it seemed to me his art was a positive self-esteem statement. The next to the oldest found a pretty picture of a girl about his age. He seemed to want to know if it would be okay to use. I said there was nothing wrong with that and he smiled such a precious smile! The oldest shared his dreams for a family. </p><p>I fell in love with AWBW all over again, and am so glad that it has prompted me to finish my education to become a children&#39;s counselor!!&quot;</p><br />

&quot;We worked on creating part of a quilt organized by the Coalition to End Hunger and Homelessness. The women and children at our house added their handprints and messages, and the quilt was used to bring a message to local government officials as part of an action before the board of supervisors. <p>We did it as part of a break in our house meeting, and everyone really liked it. It was their way of being involved and voicing their opinion. </p><p>The Coalition brought us large butcher paper to work on and we used smaller colored paper left over from a previous project. The handprints were each on a piece of bright paper attached to the butcher paper. </p><p>What we made ended up being part of a powerful 20-foot paper quilt. It looked really cool with all the different sizes of hands on the quilt - from little baby hands up to big adult hands. </p><p>It was wonderful to combine the art and advocacy.&quot;</p><br />

I loved seeing the excitement in the children when they heard the sound of their boxes. <p>I&#39;ve seen art have a tremendous positive impact on these brave children who have come into the shelter so fragile, hurt, and broken down. </p><p>I see these brave souls walk out from group with their head a little higher and a glow in their eyes. I feel rewarded just by witnessing such peace I see the children experiencing while creating their art and then leaving with the feeling of self-confidence.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;I had a chance to travel to Mexico to share the AWBW workshops with a group of professional women who are coming together to build the first domestic violence shelter in Hermosillo, capital of the state of Sonora, Mexico. This group of women visited California last year to tour the Human Options facility and model their shelter after it. A year and a half later we at Human Options were asked to travel to Hermosillo to share with the women the things we go through as a DV shelter and agency. I chose to share the Children&#39;s Windows group &quot;Creating a Safe Place&quot;(Children&#39;s Windows Manual, page 41-42).<p>Leading the art program was the best experience during my trip. I was able to share my experience and how it has helped our children. I brought some artwork from our children at Human Options and shared it with the women. They were very surprised to see all the different artwork and how it showed the ways domestic violence effects the children. Their shelter wasn&#39;t thinking about a children&#39;s program, but they are thinking about it now! </p><p>I really like AWBW and wherever I go, I want to incorporate it. I think art is a great tool for kids to express their feelings. It&#39;s one of the ways they can communicate.</p><p>In Hermosillo, when I&#8200;led the workshops, I asked the women to think like children as they participated. Some of them were shy and nervous to share at first, but everybody did so well. One woman felt comfortable opening up and then they all started to share. It was so interesting to see the different places they felt safe - the beach, the mountains, the forest, and for some it was their home. <br /></p><br />

&quot;There was one 12-year-old child who seemed very distant towards staff and would never play actively with other children or try to entertain herself. She also had a very negative view towards all class activities. <p>But once she started to participate in AWBW workshops, she soon opened up.

<![CDATA[
She became friends with another child as well as with staff and developed a positive view towards the art workshops. </p><p>I overheard her tell her mother, &#39;Art was pretty cool today.&#39; Hearing that sentence gave me such a rewarding feeling.

&quot;The children enjoyed making and sharing their scrolls. They were especially excited that they had a hallway to display them and were able to place their scrolls where they chose. The youngest child in group was unsure and not too thrilled in sharing. It was also her first day in group and in the shelter program. But, at the end of it, she was excited and made two scrolls - one she dedicated to me and it said, &quot;I love you teacher.&#39;&quot;<br />

&quot;I treasure every workshop I have with the women in our shelter. It is so gratifying to see the artwork they create and how useful it is for them to begin to heal. <p>I know AWBW makes a difference. I know because I see the smiles on the ladies&#39; faces as they proudly show the art they have created, and their tears as they share what their pieces mean to them.</p><p>I believe strongly that there is nothing better than to take time and help someone who needs it. Serving battered women and children is what I would like to do for the rest of my life.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;On our wall outside we have the kids each make a pair of handprints before they leave. It&#39;s a really big deal for them. They look forward to it and they love it. Before they leave, they pick their color, I paint their hands and then I&#8200;help them press their hands onto the wall. Then I&#8200;write their name on one hand and the date on the other. (Non-toxic acrylic paints make permanent prints.) <p>We are a transitional housing program and we offer an &#39;aftercare&#39; program for the women and kids after the leave.</p><p>Having the handprints on the wall is really special for the kids who come back to do group. They come back with their moms and always see their handprints on the wall. You can even see the handprints from the parking lot!&quot; </p><br />

&quot;Windows time is a time for the children to be free and be kids with no other responsibilities - it allows them to be themselves with more freedom than in other roles. A lot of time these children take on parenting roles in their families, so it&#39;s great to see them focus on themselves... <p>The art really relaxes them and they make so many breakthroughs - like the three sisters we have who are fiercely independent and sometimes give each other a hard time. When they were given a special Windows project to do, they all got along so well. It was great to see them work together. And there is one boy who was always self-deprecating about his art. He would get upset halfway through and write &#39;boo&#39; all over it. When we gave him a special Windows project, he put a lot of time into it even coming up with a theme. It was great to see him finish and feel proud. It was definitely a breakthrough for him!&quot;</p><br />

&quot;I led the Treasure Box workshop one-on-one with a girl who was dealing with the loss of her biological father who had been killed in a car accident when she was only three years old. She was very tearful throughout the session. Making her treasure box gave her a way to talk about her feelings and begin healing all over again. At the end she said &lsquo;Now I can write love letters to my Daddy in Heaven.&#39; She planned to store them in her special box. All the Windows staff and volunteers at our shelter enjoyed seeing this child work on this activity. It brought out a lot of feelings and emotion for her and inspired me to continue to do all that I can for the children in my shelter.&quot;<p>-Melissa Falco</p><br />

GOAL where the members have various disabilities which require guidance and help with activities. <p>One of the participants was always negative about art. He was constantly depressed and not wanting to do anything that was art. But when we presented Windows we did the Friendship Pins and used wood and magnets, he had a big smile and finished the work. We asked him how he felt. He said I like it. Much to our surprise he asked us when we can do another Windows group. He told us that his magnet is on the refrigerator and every time he looks at it he feels happy and it makes him smile. </p><p>Our goal was to create a relaxed group where the participants can enjoy themselves. That is exactly what we have achieved. It is very different from the other art groups these participants have experienced. The group members love it so much that some who are not even part of &#39;rap group&#39; want to participate.&quot; </p><br />

&quot;My name is Kimberly Lyon. I am a counselor at Angel Step Too and have been leading AWBW workshops for the women since March of 2000. Our program is unique in that we have both substance abuse and domestic violence components, which has proven to be a wonderful combination of healing for our clients in AWBW workshops. <p>The most recent highlight in having AWBW workshops was when I facilitated &lsquo;Our Mural Wishes&#39; for the first time with the women. We decided to call it &lsquo;Angel Step Too Wishes.&#39; I had set all the supplies out, taped butcher paper to the garage, introduced the workshop, put on some relaxing music, and let them begin. I walked to the office to get the staff involved (which took about 15 min. to gather them) and walked back to where the women were working. What I saw was a wonderful artistic masterpiece full of love, awesome and selfless words, and wishes for others. I was amazed and grateful to be a part of it.</p><p>My mind started working overtime and I had a &lsquo;lightbulb&#39; moment. I thought of having the children do their own mural later that afternoon. At first a few of the boys were resistant to participate. (I suggested that they participate or else no slip-n-slide). They created an even more beautiful mural than the moms. You&#39;d be amazed at how much they know and how wise they are. At the end of the workshop we began to &#39;pray out&#39; with the Serenity Prayer and instead did a couple of rounds of Ring around the Rosy, then prayed out. </p><p>It was a blast! I haven&#39;t had that much fun in a while and look forward to integrating more workshops with the children. I have learned that the more &lsquo;childlike&#39; we become, the closer we get to the source, which is truly nurturing to the spirit. May the force be with you all!&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

He always deems his friend&#39;s works as superior to his own. </p><p>On this particular occasion Terry became very involved in the activity. The fact that he could paint over the paper covered with pastels if he felt he made a mistake really facilitated his success. </p><p>It was a very inspiring and comforting to see that Terry is beginning to open up and accept himself. </p><p>Thank you to AWBW for providing such important avenues which allow the children to blossom.&quot;<br /></p><br />

&quot;The treasure box workshop was a lot of fun for me, staff, and the children. The children really were involved and creative in making their treasure boxes. They started to tell us what they wanted in their treasure boxes, and said they wanted to put their secrets inside - things that nobody else would touch. <p>After the workshop was over, they started to have a club with their treasure boxes. It lasted for a few days. They would run around and hide their boxes from other children. The mothers really liked how the children were bonding and having fun. They would not even let their moms look inside their treasure boxes. </p><p>I asked them what was inside their box and one of them said they were collecting things from the shelter so they could remember what they did here and remember us. They really enjoyed it.&quot; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;We had a boy in the shelter who was very negative and disruptive. He was one of those children nobody seems to like. At one workshop when he didn&#39;t want to talk or participate, I was able to work with him one-on-one while the other leaders continued with the rest of the group. We were doing Postive Crowns - hand cut-outs made into a crown - but instead of making a crown he decided to make a belt. I helped trace his hands and noticed that he actually loved being touched. I complimented his hand, saying it looked like a really strong hand. Then when I was thumbing through a magazine with him, he suddenly grabbed a picture of a dog, cut it out, and glued it on one of the hands. Then he grabbed another picture. It was one of those ads with a drop of water coming out of a faucet. He cut it out and glued it under the eye of the dog. He told me the dog was saying, &lsquo;Come play with me.&#39; This boy didn&#39;t have any friends and I could see how much he was expressing in that little creation. Since that workshop, I&#39;ve noticed that he has made quite a bit of progress. He looks forward to the art and cooperates. I also noticed he left his belt on the wall for many weeks, and I think he must have been proud of it.&quot;<p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;The 14-year-old shared her tunnel book with her mom present. She truly expressed deeper parts of herself. For example she said, &lsquo;On the outside there is a calm, serene desert and also waters that don&#39;t have much waves. But all the way in the back, there&#39;s a volcano, &lsquo;cause sometimes I feel like I&#39;m going to erupt.&#39;<p>I stayed after one workshop to facilitate art with one little girl who came late. We did Celebrating My Body. She said &lsquo;See... I&#39;m a fairy and I&#8200;fly in the sky with elephants, giraffes, and zebras. Sometimes when there are little fairies I do Play Group with them. It&#39;s a jungle up there!&quot; <br /></p><br />

&quot;As Glendale Police officers assigned to Community Policing, Agent Hopper and I are responsible for managing many programs.&nbsp; Earlier this year we created a partnership with Haven House where we were given the opportunity to offer the kids A Window Between Worlds.&nbsp; The children were very excited, and this program has given them the ability to express themselves in ways they have never done before.&nbsp; They enjoy the artwork and are given the chance to display their hidden talents.&nbsp; I have noticed a more relaxed group on the evenings this program is offered.&nbsp; I believe this is a very important and effective program for our at-risk kids.&nbsp; I hope it will continue to be a part of our monthly activity because A Window Between Worlds is definitely needed to help these youths who are trying so desperately to find a solid base upon which to build their lives - lives that will become self-rewarding and self-supporting.&quot; <br /><br />

<![CDATA[
&quot;When I began leading the Children&#39;s Windows Program, I co-facilitated workshops at the crisis shelter. Then last August, due to my work schedule, I switched to the outreach program. At first I was shocked by the situations these children were facing. Unlike the children at the shelter, these children were not part of any structured or safe environment. I could see that they were hanging on by their fingernails. I could see that this Windows time was the only time someone was asking them, &#39;How are you doing? How are you feeling?&#39; <p>At first it was difficult to lead. It remains difficult, but it is also incredibly rewarding. This year, I was caring for my dying brother and gave up many things, including selling my business. The Windows nights, Wednesdays, were the one thing I wouldn&#39;t give up. It was too important.</p><p>It&#39;s been a year now, and we are expanding the Children&#39;s Windows workshops to four nights a week. At Haven Hills, they are used to me and they know how passionate I am about this. They said, &#39;We will do this program every night if you are willing to invest the time,&#39; and I said, &#39;I will.&#39; One more staff person has been trained, plus we have one paid volunteer assisting. I will be holding training meetings for additional volunteers and interns as they join in. This is important work we are doing and I want them to be prepared to be effective. </p><p>I&#39;m proud of the ways I&#39;ve been able to help bring this program, and the children&#39;s needs, to the forefront. I think that the Outreach component of any shelter should be seen as an integral part of what the shelter does for the community. It is when the women are &#39;out there&#39; that you are going to see the most important part of their pain, and their children&#39;s pain. With each Children&#39;s Windows Workshop, I am fighting for them. Although each session remains very difficult, I can also see that each session makes a tremendous difference. </p><p>I&#39;m so excited to have the opportunity to provide this program for the children more than once a week.</p><br />

their moms, but today, they didn&rsquo;t have to show it to their moms or to anyone. They could just express their feelings, and then flush it down the toilet or tear it up and get rid of it. They really liked that idea.<br /><br />We used both toilet paper and regular paper. For the toilet paper, the kids folded it several times so that it wouldn&rsquo;t rip when they wrote on it. They re-folded as they went, until all of it was filled up. Medium ball-point pens worked best for writing on the toilet paper. We also had crayons and markers available. For those who wrote on paper instead of toilet paper, they ripped theirs up and threw them in the trash instead of flushing them.<br /><br />As we began, I told them that they could spread out in the room and have some privacy as they worked. I sat down and let them know I was there and whoever wanted to come tell me about their anger, that would be fine. Some shared and others didn&rsquo;t and they enjoyed it either way. It was so rewarding to see many children do more than one. They all used many sheets of paper to let out many different feelings.

&quot;Humboldt Women for Shelter, located in Humboldt County, held a survivor&#39;s art show in the month of April, 2000: &#39;Child Abuse Awareness Month.&#39; We thought the art display would be a powerful way to educate the community about what it&#39;s like to live in an abusive home. We entitled our show &#39;Heartsong: Finding The Light. Art by Adult and Child Survivors of Domestic Violence.&#39;<p>A large portion of our art show was the &#39;Children&#39;s Comfort Project.&#39; (in July 1997 Leader&#39;s Update). The quilts in this display are made up of individual squares that were created by women and children who have used our shelter&#39;s services. Themes include &#39;Friendship,&#39; &#39;Imagine A World Free of Domestic Violence,&#39; &#39;Hands Are Not For Hurting,&#39; and &#39;Scared/Safe.&#39; In addition, we had Power Animals, Dream Catchers, Intuition Dolls, Tunnel Books, Fish Families, Anger Volcanoes, and My House creations on display. We had wonderful feedback from the children who have participated in AWBW projects, and also many feedback forms returned from community members who clearly saw the depth of the art as well. Those who saw the exhibit were saddened, touched and enlightened. This proved to be a personal way to educate and raise awareness about the realities of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;It has been so overwhelmingly supportive, taking this project into the community. October 29th and 30th, at the local mall, we had 14 quilts on display, with written information about the Children&#39;s Comfort Project and about domestic violence. We also had supplies available, for making quilt squares, and invited people to come make a square for a community quilt. The theme for the quilt was &#39;Hands are not for hurting - I will not use my hands for violence&#39; or &#39;Imagine a world free of domestic violence.&#39; Fifteen teens stopped by to make squares for a Teen Quilt. All together 60 people of all ages, from infant to great grandparents, stopped by to make squares. Many more stopped to look at the quilts, ask questions, and express verbal support. It&#39;s been very powerful to feel the support of our community - refusing to accept domestic violence, and actively visioning a future free of domestic violence.&quot; <br /><br />

&quot;The kids LOVED the &lsquo;Cheering Frog Flags&#39; workshop! They especially liked the extra flags that we, as leaders, made for them. It was great to watch them beam with positive affirmations about themselves! They said things like &lsquo;I am a champion!&#39; &lsquo;I&#39;m the coolest kid ever!&#39;<p>We&#39;ve started to use this project to help them with their difficult feelings that come up when they are about to leave the shelter. We&#39;ve found that they often feel sad, and even come to the group crying. What we&#39;ve done is, each staff person makes a special affirmation flag for that particular child, and then we string them together to give the child when he or she leaves. Just like children are special in their own way, each flag is unique. When we give them their cheering frog flags, they feel like they are leaving with something from each of us, and they get to have us with them. </p><p>We are going to use this workshop ongoing, so all the kids are familiar with it. That way, we can present cheering frog flags to any child when they are about to leave, and they will understand. This project is a great way for us to celebrate their time at the shelter, and help them take the good memories and support with them.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;Our Three Wishes workshop brought tears to my eyes and to the children&#39;s as we struggled with WISHES. Two of our children had become homeless after fleeing the domestic violence in their homes. Months of homelessness have reduced their wishes to basics... a car to escape in... a wish to see a friend she once had... a home so they wouldn&#39;t have to move anymore... a wish to attend school. Because it was so powerful, I am sending copies of their artwork on to you.&quot;<br />

&quot;It was rewarding to see the kids able to express their anger in such a constructive, free forum provided by the &#39;Expressing Anger&#39; workshop. <p>Because they were all siblings, they had anger toward one another, and verbalized it, so that they saw how much anger they had for one another. As leader, I had to be careful about not hurting feelings in mediating this group. </p><p>They were able to really let their anger out in positive ways, and I loved seeing them finally able to release their anger effectively, without taking it out on each other. It was an excellent workshop, and very therapeutic for the kids. One of them summed it up, saying &lsquo;That felt really good!&#39;&quot;<br /></p><br />

&ldquo;At our Windows Workshops we always have a Check-out circle at the end after the art-sharing circle. <br /><br />The Check-out is a question like:<br />What&rsquo;s one thing you like about yourself?<br />What&rsquo;s one thing you&rsquo;re good at or do well?<br />What&rsquo;s one way you&rsquo;re going to take care of yourself?<br />What&rsquo;s something you like about the person sitting to your right?<br />Share a rose and a thorn (a rose is a strength or something going well in your life and a thorn is something you&rsquo;re struggling with).<br /><br />The Check-out circle helps the women have a sense of closure and leave the group on a positive note.&rdquo; <br /><br />

&quot;As a leader, I find that recently I have been working mostly with younger children. As they don&#39;t write or spell that well, some of the workshops are difficult when it comes to the written word. <p>When I did the &#39;My Body&#39; workshop, the kids came up with the idea to draw their thoughts around their bodies. When it came time to share at the end of the workshop, the kids explained what they drew around their bodies. Sometimes it was a shape, a color, an animal, etc. </p><p>It was easier for them to express themselves through symbols than words. In addition, as they were talking at the end, they were able to share even more as they explained their symbols.&quot; </p><br />

with a new director and a renewed outlook. We&#39;ve even re-named our children&#39;s program to be called the Child Development Center. <p>Since we&#39;ve had such a struggle during the past year we are especially thrilled to be resuming the Children&#39;s Windows on a regular basis. We are proud to say that Mondays are our Windows days. </p><p>Of all our recent Windows highlights, I&#39;d like to share one story of a twelve-year old boy who refused to do the art. </p><p>Veronica Loza was leading the &quot;Three Wishes&quot; workshop with me assisting. We had chosen the workshop because we wanted the children to be able to deal with issues from their pasts. Three Wishes is an opportunity for the children to create a wish for their past, a wish for their present, and a wish for their future. We found that the children were confused about what we meant by the past. Veronica shared her own three wishes that that she had created at the AWBW training. After seeing Veronica&#39;s wishes for herself, the children were ready to create their own, and we played soft music for the quiet creation time. </p><p>When the twelve-year-old boy had refused to do the project, we welcomed him to not do it, but said he needed to stay in the room with us. As we began creating, he joined in. What was so amazing with this particular boy was that after all of his resistance, he really was dealing with issues from the past. He actually sat down and drew himself with red lightning through him, representing his wish for his past. He wrote on it, &#39;I wish I wasn&#39;t torn apart from the past.&#39; His wish for the future was &quot;To become a draw-er.&#39; Through the workshop, he was able to find an outlet for some of what he had experienced, and he was able to find a sense of hope and identity for his future.</p><p>This project is a great thinking tool for the children. All of them participated. So much of what they expressed in their past wishes related to the domestic violence. Likewise, their future wishes reflected how they don&#39;t want same for their futures.</p><p>As we launch our new Child Development Center, the Windows workshops are a central part of our programs. We made sure to get this program up and running as soon as we could. It&#39;s so important for the children to be able to process their feelings about the domestic violence, and that&#39;s what they do through the art.&quot;<br /></p><br />

&quot;We had a three-year-old boy who, when he came to the shelter, did not interact with any of the staff members and did not want to be away from his mother. Every day we asked him to join our group and he did not want to.<p>After about two weeks, he came to our group, sat down and participated. After that day, he was the first one at the table and he was the first one to share his work with the group. He would share with us about himself and his family and all the &#39;neat&#39; things he found in the backyard.</p><p>We believe that this boy as well as other children like him would not have felt the opportunity to open himself up without the Windows program. The program doesn&#39;t just benefit the children for the hour that they work on the projects. The effects can be seen in all situations throughout the day.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;The Children&#39;s Program at W.C.C.S. has come a long way since its initial start-up in July of 1997. At the time there was just one aide and myself. I currently have four aides and one assistant taking part.<p>From the very beginning, I had recognized the importance and need for providing children with an outlet for expressing their inner world. AWBW would provide just that.</p><p>One of the challenges I encountered when first leading the art workshops was working with a mixed age group and not having enough help. The following suggestions I recommend for this scenario: </p><p>1. If at all possible, have two groups or separate tables.<br />2. Choose an art activity that can be adapted for that particular group, i.e. - &#39;Water Mandalas&#39; is great for any age or &#39;A Fairytale About Me&#39; - You can use drawing paper and markers to substitute clay.<br />3. Talk to your Director about hiring more staff or getting trained volunteers.</p><p>During warm-ups, it&#39;s important to be silly and creative. When this occurs, you are providing an avenue for the kids to have fun, relax and join in. Once they are familiar with a warm-up and appear to enjoy it, I then ask for volunteers to lead the warm-up. They are excited about leading and achieve self-confidence.</p><p>The children have truly become my teachers when it comes to paving my direction to meeting their needs. Art is a passage that mirrors their inner world.</p><br />

&quot;I found that when we have a busy group with a lot of children, I&#39;m especially glad we have the Cray-Pas oil pastels. Paint would be too much of a hazard when the room is so full of people, but the Cray-Pas are terrific. They&#39;ve been a big success at my shelter. One little boy comes to the group three times a week. Every time he comes, he asks if we can do something with the Cray-Pas! Even the mothers want to use them.&quot;<br />

&quot;We are starting A Day of Feelings workshop, and I was working with a 7-year-old girl who didn&#39;t want to do the warm-up. She was just sitting there. Kinda not sure, maybe shy, maybe a little bit of attitude... So, during the warm-up, I started making up my own song, with my own tune. Then very enthusiastically and happily, I started doing the workshop. She started laughing at me and then she said &#39;Oh, I have one, I have one!&#39; Once she got comfortable, she started getting very innovative.&quot;<br /> <br />

&quot;Every time after I have conducted a workshop with a group of children, they always ask, &#39;When are we going to have another art workshop?&#39; This question in and of itself is rewarding. Conducting these workshops gives me and the children quality time to get to know one another, helping to build trust within the relationship. <p>Many times the mothers of these children come into the shelter stressed out, and have unknowingly lost sight of their children&#39;s needs. The workshops give the children their own time to honor their needs. I always make it a point to tell the children this is their &#39;window of time&#39; to express whatever they are feeling. </p><p>Children who have difficulty expressing their anger in a positive way learn through the workshop. The tools I&#39;ve learned through the Children&#39;s Windows Program have helped me help the children become calm, peaceful, and a pleasure to be around! It&#39;s amazing seeing a hurt and troubled child transform into a creative and positive one.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;Although I am a Children&#39;s Windows leader, I conducted my first workshop with the mothers in order to introduce and familiarize them with their children&#39;s routine. I felt it would be best for the ladies to experience the Windows program first-hand as participants so that they might gain a greater appreciation of their children&#39;s work. <p>Indeed, once the women had participated in the exercises, they were much more receptive to the art created by their own children. It went over so well, I am considering doing this once a month with the women until we are able to train a leader for the Women&#39;s Windows Program.</p><p>The mothers said: &#39;I feel like a kid again,&#39; &#39;My wishes are staring me in the face. It&#39;s up to me to make them come true.&#39;&quot;</p><br />

&quot;My 5-year-old son was having trouble handling his anger. I decided to try using art to help him express his feelings. I began working with him when he was calm to let him gain confidence and skill in drawing, painting, and writing. I told him I would be his &#39;secretary&#39; and write down his words for him until he learned to write himself. I could see that this made him feel very special-the first step in helping him. <p>I then told him that we needed to figure out a better way for him to handle his feelings, especially his anger and that I thought art might be the thing to try. He seemed excited about this. I began to suggest that when he got angry I would quietly remind him to think about what he was feeling and to try to focus it into some art so that we could talk about exactly what had made him upset. </p><p>Once when he was very frustrated with his sister and said he wanted to hit her, I said &quot;Now what can you do with your feelings besides hit your sister?&quot; He immediately stopped what he was going to do and said enthusiastically, &#39;OK Mommy!&#39; He knew what to do without saying it-he ran to get drawing paper and markers and he spent the next 20 minutes drawing an extremely detailed picture of everything that happened and why it made him angry. After he had finished drawing and explained to me what he had drawn, he was not angry and seemed ready to move on to the next thing. </p><p>Later that week, his teacher spoke to me after school and remarked that she had noticed a big difference in his behavior and asked what I was doing that was helping him. I shared about AWBW and using art as a healing tool. She loved hearing about it and even wanted to bring me into the classroom to work with the whole group of children.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;I am in awe of what an important tool art is, specifically Windows art, as an aid to recovery and working through problems and insights. The workshops make the children really think about life issues and the changes they want to make in order to achieve those goals. It is one of the most powerful tools I have as an educator. <p>We had a new family with three kids and at the end of the project they said, &lsquo;This is the best school, and we don&#39;t want to leave.&#39; Their words were worth a million dollars to me. </p><p>My favorite thing is hearing all the ideas and concepts they have and share. We had a big group of school-age kids who were very active and noisy. I loved seeing how art settled them, calmed them, soothed them, and spoke to them. When the kids really get immersed in their projects it&#39;s a golden moment and the room gets really quiet. </p><p>The Windows projects are as much of a value to me as they are to the children. It&#39;s a renewal for me. Almost every time we have the art program it really touches my heart.&quot; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

Last month the Women&#39;s Windows leader was out sick. I didn&#39;t want the women to miss out on their Windows time, so I decided to combine the Women&#39;s group with the Children&#39;s group. I explained to them that I am a Children&#39;s Leader and that we would be doing a children&#39;s workshop. Everyone really liked the idea, and so we did The Monster in Me workshop. Everyone was really focused on creating their monsters. Even the young kids were really focused, but it was still fun. The women had such a good time being monsters. <p>After everyone was done, the children shared about their Monsters first. The women were so moved by what the children expressed that half of them were crying, even the women who didn&#39;t have kids were moved and cried. Some of the women didn&#39;t know and didn&#39;t think their children were capable of feeling and expressing some of the things they shared. They were grateful that they had the chance to hear how their children are feeling and how domestic violence has affected them. </p><p>The women enjoyed this so much! They requested that we combine again.&quot; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;The CD art activity was such a success! The girls were wonderfully challenged. It helped them consider their outward presentation and interior world, all in a hip and cool way.<p>The project totally jived with our GirlPower Camp goals, one of which was to build a stronger sense of self. Not only did the activity invite the girls to see themselves in a more complex way, but it was a self-esteem booster, and a centering device. What kind of world will they create? What kind of person will they be? The CD art activity assumes each girl is a gift to the world-unique and beautiful and strong.</p><p>After we completed the CDs, they were showcased for the family members. Feedback forms indicated that the CD art activity was one of the girls&#39; favorites.&quot;</p><p>Kesa Kivel<br />GirlPower Camp<br />YWCA - Santa Monica/Westside</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;I was so inspired by my first training that I couldn&#39;t wait to get back to the shelter and get started with the kids. My first experience was a big surprise. It took me a moment to realize what was happening. I had given a 3-year-old crayons and at first he just looked at them. Then he picked one up and smelled and tasted it. I realized he had never used a crayon, and knew my work had to start on a very basic level. I took the crayon and showed him how to draw circles. Then I showed him how to trace his own hand. He was amazed and thrilled - it was his first experience with art! I started slowly and had him color everyday. It was so inspiring to see his discoveries. <p>Being at the AWBW training and doing my own art made me so much more in tune with the children. I could see how you have to go really deep into yourself when you create. &#8200;It helped me understand that it&#39;s hard to share sometimes. Before the training, I used to try to convince the kids to share about their art. Now I just know how important their expressions are, and they can tell it&#39;s safe to open up when they are ready.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br />

&quot;Last month we did the Fish Families workshop with the children. It was great to see how it impacted the children, helping them better express their feeling about their families. The kids really got into it and most of them made more than one. One child described her family all separated within her picture with different members in different corners. <p>One little boy who usually says he&#39;s bored came to group and said he did not want to do the project. I told him he didn&#39;t have to participate but he had to stay in the room. After a little while he changed his mind and did the project. Once he got going he was the most excited about the project and even said how fun it was. </p><p>During our supervisor meeting some of the counselors that meet with the children individually told us how during their sessions with the &#39;sand tray therapy&#39; the children told their family story using fish. It was as if they felt safer using their fish to express their feelings about their family.&quot;</p><br />

&quot;I was inspired by the January 2002 workshop, &lsquo;Journey Footprints.&#39; At a parenting class, I had the women work together to create two lists, one to represent everything they were walking away from and one to represent everything they were walking toward. <p>I typed each list of words and shared copies of them for the women to use in their collages the next week (we were able to have workshops twice that week). </p><p>For the first session, we created &#39;Walking Away&#39; collage footprints to represent the past and everything they were trying to walk away from. They used the words in their collages. On the second day, we did &lsquo;The Future is in My Hands&#39; handprint collages. They made collage handprints that represented the things they are working towards, again, using the words in their collages.&quot;<br /></p><br />

&quot;It&#39;s really remarkable seeing how the art reaches those who have a lot of difficulty being in a shelter. The perception of some clients is that shelter life is similar to life with an abuser because of the restrictions in regard to certain behaviors. At times clients also feel like we ask too much of them. <p>However, when it comes to the Windows program they always want more of it. In the execution of daily appointments, a client will have to miss a workshop and they will actually ask to do make-up work for Windows. </p><p>In the leave-take evaluations clients fill out at the end of their shelter stay, a traditional response about a the Windows program can be summed up in these two remarks:</p><p>&lsquo;All the sessions should have been longer ESPECIALLY the Windows.&#39;</p><p>&lsquo;I found Window&#39;s workshops to be very peaceful.&#39;<br /></p>

&ldquo;Once a resident entered the shelter during our art group. She had bruises and was obviously badly shaken. I asked her if she would like to join us and she nodded... She sat down slowly, tears streaming down her face. She didn&rsquo;t say a word, just began to paint the project in front of her. <br /><br />Several weeks later we talked and she told me how much it had meant to her on her first day in the shelter to be &lsquo;invited into our group.&rsquo; She said she felt comfortable being in the group, and that she cherished the silence we shared. Without the pressure of having to talk, to tell her story, it gave her moments she needed to &lsquo;get herself together&rsquo; and it was during that first group that she began to feel safe.<br /><br />I am astonished over and over again at how creative and expressive these women become when they are handed even the smallest of considerations. Their time spent in art is time just for them, and it&rsquo;s a time they feel secure to express some of their fears, hopes, and dreams.&rdquo; <br /><br />

&ldquo;I feel wonderful knowing I can give the women time to get away from all the noise and chaos of the city and even the shelter itself. I feel privileged to be able to show them a whole new world, and it&rsquo;s great when we have women who have never experienced any connection with nature. I think mother nature provides a great tool for healing, and the women feel the same. As one lady expressed to us: &lsquo;I wish we could do this more often. I feel safe and it&#39;s so beautiful.&rsquo; Another woman told us the trails reminded her of her childhood in Mexico, and a time when there was no violence in her life.&rdquo;

&ldquo;My favorite thing about leading the art program is getting the people who don&#39;t want to participate to participate, and then getting them to the point where they can&#39;t live without AWBW group. For example, one client was sitting there and pouting and did not want to participate, but about 15 minutes into group he started to &lsquo;play&#39; around and really got into it. As he hurried up to finish his project, he told me he loved the group and couldn&#39;t wait until next week. (Valley Oasis also serves battered men).<br /><br />It&rsquo;s rewarding to see the big difference the workshops can make in the clients&rsquo; lives. I had one client who had overcome being shot twice in the neck, and the art made her kind of deal with it. We were doing the three dimensional workshop with &lsquo;past, present, and future&rsquo; and before the workshop she was not going to get a restraining order and was going to go back to her abuser. After doing the project she decided to take another route and get help filing the restraining order. I think the workshop made her open up to realize her situation. She had been seeing the signs but ignoring them, and the project opened her eyes to see the reality of what had happened to her and what was going on.<br /><br />For me as leader, the group makes a difference as well. One time I was really having a down day, and was leading group. Well, I guess the group noticed and started to use some of the philosophy on me that I use in group with them. I was cheered up, and I realized that as a AWBW leader I need to let myself love and be touched by the art groups too.<br /><br />I would encourage all leaders to always remember to do an opening circle. And when you do, remember that not everyone wakes up on &lsquo;the right side of the bed.&rsquo; If a woman just isn&#39;t into it that morning and doesn&#39;t want to participate you can let them walk out for a minute, take a breath of fresh air or even a smoke. They appreciate that. They like that it&rsquo;s a special time with no pressure.&rdquo;<br />

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loved the art of creating ever since I was a little girl and through the years have always had some project going on. When surfing the net one day, I came upon a link to AWBW. I was so thrilled and knew I&#8200;had to bring this wonderful program to our agency. An art professor from our university painted the mural on the door and as time went on I&#8200;got more daring and inspired to create this room as a very special place to come into and heal. Now, the art room seems to be almost creating itself. More painted walls, curtains, and stars have been added. It&rsquo;s like entering a magical kingdom.&rdquo; <br /><br /><br /><br />

&ldquo;I first made a pillow with one client in the shelter, I decided to use felt because it was cuddly. Neither of us knew much about sewing and spent most of the time giggling. What I found out from this experience was that the felt was easier to sew and the<br />workshop can take a lot longer than you think... depending on the participant&rsquo;s sewing ability.<br /><br />The next time I did this workshop I had a group of seventeen teenage girls at an alternative school. Wow they had fun! I found out that you need lots of thread or embroidery floss, at least a spool for every two people, and you need to help them thread the needles! The girls were very creative and made different shapes... one even made her pillow into a moon shape. <br /><br />I still remember one of the teachers sticking their head into the classroom and looking at us all with shock. Later she asked me, &#39;How did you get them to sew?&#39; I think it was just because the workshop was so attractive to them. The pocket was the selling point! A place to hide, and treasure thoughts and dreams! It also helped to have already made one so I could show them how easy it was.<br /><br />Melissa joined me in this endeavor and created a really cool pocket complete with a button on it! Melissa has since gone on and inspired other staff at Haven House to create pillows. One staff person, Lynette, makes one almost everytime she&rsquo;s on hotline!<br />Melissa has started to create pillows with kids too and they love it!<br /><br />

&quot;I recently had the opportunity to speak to two Women&#39;s Studies classes at San Diego State University. Both classes had a small background on domestic violence but had not spent significant time on the subject. I was able to give them more background and information on shelter life and complete a whole Windows workshop. <br /><br />&#39;I Am&#39; with &#39;Echo Listening&#39; worked very well (from the Women&rsquo;s Windows Manual). That workshop requires few supplies and is extremely impactful. I presented the workshop to the students as though they were leaders in training and also with the opportunity to participate. <br /><br />At first, the students were not so excited to write, stating feelings of being &#39;tired&#39; and &#39;burnt-out&#39; during the opening circle to &#39;feeling good&#39; and &#39;their heart was pounding,&#39; after the experience of Echo Listening. This was a great experience and I feel that it has made me a better leader. I look forward to participating in the classroom next semester!

&ldquo;Windows has such an honored place in our program. At Good Shepherd, the Sisters have a saying that each soul is more important than a whole world. <br /><br />We often individualize the art program for every woman and child. Sometimes we make special arrangements to create a time for the women to bond with their children. One woman was having an especially hard time getting used to the shelter. Now this woman is totally invested when doing art as opposed to other programs. She and her oldest daughter had the hardest time communicating without fighting. Now, this mom takes time with each of her children. Setting time aside with her daughter has allowed them to do something that they both enjoy doing individually and together. They are learning to communicate better and get along with a lot less fighting.<br /><br />The art time gives the opportunity for the women to re-bond with their children and to feel their role as a mom.&rdquo;

&quot;I recently led a &#39;self-nurturing stones&#39; workshop for a group of caregivers.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like Affirmation Gems (May 1999 Update) but instead of creating a series of gems, the women each created one single, beautiful stone for themselves with a word on it to remind them of self-nurturing.&nbsp; We used colored sculpey clay and Prang metallic markers. &nbsp;<br /><br />I led the guided color relaxation from Affirmation Hearts (August 2000 Update).&nbsp; Then I said &lsquo;Choose colors you are attracted to, and choose a word that reminds you to take care of yourself or makes you feel better whenever you see it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Each woman pressed and swirled her colors together to make a sculpey stone and wrote her word on the stone with a regular pen and then filled in the word with a metallic pen after baking it.&nbsp; Each stone was a beautiful reminder to take care of ourselves. <br /><br />

&ldquo;Recently we had &lsquo;Mom and Daughter Day&rsquo; and did the Family Footprints workshop (January 2002 Update). Everyone really expressed themselves and learned things about each other that they didn&rsquo;t know. It turned out beautifully.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m very passionate about this art expression because I see so many women come in feeling insecure about expressing themselves in any kind of way. I tell them they can just watch and as they see the group unfold, they always want to start participating. They say &lsquo;This seems wonderful. I didn&rsquo;t know it was going to be this wonderful!&rsquo;<br /><br />Sometimes I see women come to the group angry. I see their arms all tense as they put them on the table. It&rsquo;s amazing to see their bodies start to relax as they begin creating. They look so forward to the art groups. They can flow with it. &rdquo; <br />

&ldquo;I love doing the Handprints workshop (Update March 1999) with our clients at Su Casa Family Crisis Center. Recently one of our clients was hearing impaired. She became frustrated because she could not relax. She couldn&rsquo;t hear the music or the introduction. I had to show her with my hands what I was trying to get across. She started to work on her &#39;hands,&#39; and it was hard for her because the other clients were sharing with each other and she couldn&rsquo;t hear them. Then it came time for her to show her &#39;hands.&#39; Her picture told a story of her batterer and her DV. We could see the person she was before and after she met her batterer. The other women in the group didn&rsquo;t need to hear her story in words. They were able to understand just by looking at her &#39;hands.&#39; Her story was told for all to see. Words, who needs words to bring out deep feelings of sadness and loss? My client cried when she realized the other participants understood her &#39;hands.&#39; It was a challenge with a happy ending. This is the first time that I&#8200;have had a hearing impaired client in one of my groups. It was very rewarding learning alternate ways of making ourselves understood. <br /><br />

&ldquo;For my very first workshop I led a project called Stepping Stones. We started by talking about how sometimes in our lives our hardest struggles can become important stepping stones on our journey. One stone at a time, we can take down the walls standing in our way and make them into stepping stones.<br /><br />As the women began to create their &lsquo;stepping stones,&rsquo; I saw birds, trees, flowers, and crosses emerging from the clay. They did everything but stones. <br /><br />At first I was worried because they weren&rsquo;t making stones. But when it was time for each woman to share what her &lsquo;stepping stone&rsquo; meant to her, many of the women were crying. It was very moving and I could see that they got exactly what they were supposed to get from this workshop. I knew that even though it hadn&rsquo;t gone how I had thought I wanted it to go, it had gone just right!&rdquo; <br /><br />

&ldquo;I was getting ready to lead my first group, and I noticed that one of the women who came to the table was someone who&rsquo;s usually fairly resistant about sharing and participating. I was a little nervous, thinking to myself &lsquo;this is going to be hard!&rsquo; <br /><br />I kept the workshop simple, just having the women create a shape to express how they were feeling, and fill the page with colors. <br /><br />After the workshop, the woman I was nervous about went straight to her counselor and said that she loved the group! She was surprised at how the time flew by (so different from how she feels in most groups watching the time drag.) And she said that what she really got out of the workshop was that after she leaves the shelter, when she&rsquo;s feeling anxious, she&rsquo;s going to pull out some crayons and draw instead of watching TV. She was so happy to discover how it helps just to get the feelings out.&rdquo;<br /><br />

&ldquo;I was leading the Inner Lilies workshop and as I walked around the room, I told one of the women her picture was beautiful and deep. I pointed out how her flower glowed so wonderfully through the layers of color. I said that it showed what a deep and beautiful person she was. <br /><br />She said &lsquo;Thank you so much for saying that,&rsquo; and she began to cry. &lsquo;Nobody has ever told me I was beautiful in any way&mdash;all my life. Thank you.&rsquo; She was about my age. I&rsquo;m 56. <br /><br />It&rsquo;s wonderful to see how the art can be so deeply validating.&rdquo; <br /><br /><br /><br />

&ldquo;When I started doing the windows groups we did not have a place to display the women&#39;s art work, so I took it upon myself to take up some space in the entrance hall to display their projects. I chose the entrance hall so that everyone who visits or comes in can enjoy them also. This is our display board for our WINGS Window Between Worlds. The mothers that choose to display their work, like to show their children what they have done. I&#39;ve heard the mothers do this and you can hear how proud they are about the project, and the children also get excited to see their moms&rsquo; work. When the family leaves our program, the mom takes her projects with her. These groups usually are very helpful for the women, and they also help us understand the women a little more.&rdquo; <br /><br /><br />

&ldquo;Preparing to have our exhibit made our art workshops extra intense and exciting. With the exhibit ahead of them, the women knew they had a special opportunity to reach out and use their voices. They knew other people were going to be able to read their words and see their work, and it provided tremendous validation. Many of the women never thought they were creative, and they discovered talents and a joy for art that they hadn&rsquo;t known before. Others rediscovered talents that had been buried because of the abuse. For all of them, it nurtured the creative part of their spirits. It meant so much to them to know we thought their work was important and should be displayed. It wasn&rsquo;t easy to find a space for the exhibit. Initially, we had to postpone the show when one location fell through. But it was well worth the efforts. We had the exhibit and reception at a local framing store. For so many people viewing the art, it was their first time being exposed to domestic violence and being able to hear the stories and and experiences of battered women.&quot;

&ldquo;Doing the Windows groups has been a tremendous experience. I&rsquo;ve gotten many great ideas from the Windows Update newsletters. One I&rsquo;ve put into practice that&rsquo;s really gone well is the Mural (Nov. &lsquo;99) with the theme being &lsquo;Our Wishes for Women and Children in Shelter.&rsquo; I had thought it might not be as effective because I am not fluent in Spanish and some of the residents in the group were Spanish-speaking only, but it posed no barrier. In fact, it has been most effective in allowing the women of all cultures to express themselves.&rdquo;<br /> <br />

&quot;Sometimes the Windows groups bring up deep feelings and it&rsquo;s important to help the participants find a sense of closure before leaving. At a recent training we discussed some creative endings to help the particpants walk out of the room with a sense of strength. &quot; <br /><br />Patricia Curtis shares a special way she closes her art groups: poetry. She takes a minute to read one of the poems after the women have all shared about their art work. The poems help create a sense of safety and completion. <br /><br /><br />

While we were there a woman came and taught art classes which I enjoyed and found very helpful. She gave me your flyer on the Survivor&rsquo;s Art Circle. <br /><br />My son and I are now in our own house and I start a new job on Monday. It feels like life is falling into place. <br /><br />I have always used art in my life, but stopped as I lost myself.

&ldquo;I&#39;ve found that in doing the art workshops, it&#39;s been important for me to find ways to keep my spirit inspired and my creativity alive. <br /><br />It has helped me to find relaxing, nonstressful activities like walking or reading or going to hear favorite authors speak. I always keep a journal by my bed so that I can write down any ideas that come to me before I fall asleep. <br /><br />I tell the women to write down whatever creative sparks that come to them, however small or insignificant they may seem at the time, because they never know where they might lead.&rdquo;

&quot;It is always a joy to see the workshops help open up the women. One woman wanted to make a crucifix for her children, even though they weren&rsquo;t with her, so that they would know God would always be there for them. <br /><br />Another woman, who had scars along her arms, was unable to relax. I could feel her tension. So I suggested she could just squeeze the sculpey clay. Then, at the end of the workshop, I had her flatten the piece of sculpey and write something on it. She wrote her child&rsquo;s name, and smiled as she said, &lsquo;Now I have something to give my baby.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br />

&quot;I recently did a &lsquo;cards of encouragement&rsquo; workshop and found it a beautiful process for the women in expressing what they would have liked to have said to themselves during a particular difficult time in their past. A lot of them found it difficult to think of encouraging themselves, but easier to imagine what they would say to another person in the same situation. This workshop was also powerful for the older children. One 13-year-old male has always found it difficult to express his feelings because of this father&rsquo;s role-modeling. He usually refuses to write anything as we are doing a workshop. This time he titled his work. The picture he drew of a difficult time was titled &lsquo;Prisoners of War&rsquo; and a picture of a happier time was titled &lsquo;A Happy Place.&rsquo; Because he didn&rsquo;t write inside his card, I asked if it would be okay for each of us in the group to tell him what we would want to say to him, and he agreed. We then each wrote in his card what we had said aloud. It was very powerful. &rdquo;<br /><br />

&quot;WOW!&nbsp; What a powerful workshop!&nbsp; I have done it with participants at our shelter and in our outreach support group.&nbsp; It helped each of us look at the mask we often wear to cover our true feelings as we struggle for survival in a domestic violent relationship. &nbsp;<br /><br />Through visualization, we were able to really look deeply at the mask victims have had to wear and why, what its purpose has been, the good and the bad.&nbsp; Each of us created our own personal mask, writing about the process as we went, then going back to the visualization to set aside the mask we&#39;ve worn (knowing that we can pick it up and wear it any time we need, to lessen the fear of setting it aside). In freedom we can live without the mask, with our true self visible.<br /><br />I also adapted this project for a workshop with my co-workers on a team-building day, so that each staff person could look at the mask we sometimes put on when working in the midst of crisis on a day-to-day basis. We had a chance to explore why we sometimes have a mask, what is good about it, what is not good about it, and do we really need it?<br /><br />Again ... WOW! Powerful work!<br /><br /><br /><br />

&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m finding is that even though a lot of my women are so excited about doing the art, they want to bypass the relaxation. I let them know that the relaxation is important for some of the workshops where they need to get to that quiet place and do some soul searching. <br /><br />Then there are the women who say &#39;I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t,&#39; and I say we&rsquo;re going to eliminate that word out of our vocabulary right now. Sometimes people are afraid that whatever they make isn&rsquo;t going to turn out perfect. I understand that, and let them know it&rsquo;s their time and if they just want to sit there and appreciate, that&rsquo;s fine. After a while, they start encouraging the ones who are creating, and that appreciation keeps them involved.&rdquo;

e working with the women in a counseling session before I do a workshop. About an hour into it, I&#8200;come in and after some relaxation, we go right into the artwork. The counseling has helped bring back memories and emotions, so the women are much more ready and open to do art. <br /><br />I do workshops with women from outreach and CalWORKs now. There was a woman who was in our outreach class, who said she hadn&rsquo;t drawn for many years, not since she was a young teen, because she just never made the time for it. She said how much she used to love art and drawing. Wow! The woman was a true artist. After the class was over, she told me she would always set aside time for herself and do art, because it gives her so much peace, serenity and joy. She said how thankful she was that the class was able to bring her back to that special time in her life.&quot; <br /><br />

&ldquo;Time and time again, I see women whose &lsquo;walls&rsquo; make it hard for them to express in words what they can easily release through art, music, color, and time for themselves. One such example is the story of a client with a gang, &lsquo;homegirl&rsquo; attitude that was very hard to penetrate.<br /><br />It&rsquo;s not shyness; it&rsquo;s maybe a fear that what she&rsquo;s thinking is not acceptable, not okay. She lives in a family where the father is an addict and alcoholic and the mother is forever pretending to everybody else that everything is fine. Yet, this particular client expresses herself so well when it comes to art or writing. She loves being able to say with pictures what she had found hard to say or didn&rsquo;t want to say before.<br /><br />This is what she said: &lsquo;I know it&rsquo;s not okay, but it&rsquo;s so hard for me to say that. I don&rsquo;t want to lie and say everything&rsquo;s fine, because I know it&rsquo;s not. Colors and images express so much. I get so excited trying to combine one thing to another. It feels like I&rsquo;m telling a story through pictures. Then again, maybe it only makes sense to me; but I feel such a release.&rsquo;&rdquo; <br /><br />

&quot;I led a group of four women in a writing workshop (&#39;I Am&#39;). At first, I was worried because two of the women spoke only Spanish, one woman spoke only English, and one woman spoke German and some English. I speak English and Spanish, and I was hoping that my translations would be close to what was being expressed. <br /><br />As it turned out, the women were deeply affected by what was shared. Tears were shed as they each understood and empathized with each other&rsquo;s pain and suffering. I was very happy to discover that language is not a barrier when it comes to communicating the experience of domestic violence.&rdquo;<br /><br />

&quot;I wanted to share with you what the program has done for me. When I first came to the training and AWBW, I hated art. I began to align with most of the women I did workshops with, in that I also felt I was no good at art or being creative. After running the program a few times, I started to realize that it wasn&#39;t about art, it was about what I was feeling, what the women were feeling, and how good it felt to express it in a messy, silly, ugly way. It has opened up a new light for me as far as self-expression. Once I took it as my OWN stuff, it became fun and so relaxing. Now, knowing several workshops by heart, I feel I will continue to use them as a therapist, and also in my own life.&quot;<br /><br />

&ldquo;There was one woman in my domestic violence class who was also in a class for anger management, and she was really difficult to deal with in all the groups&mdash;everybody was having a problem with her attitude. I had just started doing the Women&rsquo;s Windows workshops, and I was concerned about how she would be with the other women, because she was so confrontational and had so much trouble being in a group. But I did a workshop and she cried the whole time. She said she didn&rsquo;t know why she was crying, and I told her that was fine, that it was alright to cry. We did the watercolors, and she created the most beautiful pictures. By the second and third set we did, she was just flowing with it. After that, I noticed a real difference with her within the domestic violence group. It helped release her to be freer within the group. It helped her to calm down and focus, and really look toward her own issues instead of pointing the finger at other people with her anger.&rdquo; <br />

&quot;At each workshop I find that someone is doing something they haven&#39;t done before and really enjoying it, or perhaps they had forgotten they had enjoyed doing it.&nbsp; The special ones are those who claim they can&#39;t do anything, and then find that they have created something they and the other women really appreciate.&nbsp; I find that much of what the women have experienced or are experiencing is reflected in what they are creating.&nbsp; One woman did a collage with pictures that reminded her of what she and her children used to do together.&nbsp; They projected hope and freedom and personal goals in a variety of ways. Not a workshop goes by without some joyful moments.&quot;

&ldquo;Some of the women get a little nervous, maybe a little emotional, when they start a group. I tell them we&rsquo;re going to do art, and if they want to join in, they can. Once they trust it&rsquo;s okay to be themselves, they enjoy it. <br /><br />I think the relaxed, open atmosphere of the art groups help create an opportunity for the women to share themselves and their artwork. <br /><br />It makes me feel really good to see the women&rsquo;s faces after they&rsquo;ve finished an art piece, expecially for the first time. There&rsquo;s a little sparkle in their eyes that tells me how proud they are that they&rsquo;ve made something with their own hands.&rdquo;<br /><br />

taff involved. I also wanted to leave a message to those women who weren&rsquo;t there that group happened and they might want to be there next week. So, I stretched butcher paper down the hallway wall and wrote across the top, &#39;Our wishes for women in shelter.&#39; I began drawing my own wishes, and soon I was joined by the one resident and the staff. We filled the paper and added more. Then we left another swath of paper for those residents who weren&rsquo;t there that evening so that they could add their wishes when they returned. We now have a beautiful mural and increased investment in the art groups at the shelter from both residents and staff.&rdquo;

&quot;I appreciate the way so many of the workshop parcipants come to the art with a free and easy spirit, willing to try new things, and not worrying that it won&#39;t be good enough. It inspires me to try to have that same outlook when I do my own art.<br /><br />If I were to pick one benefit I feel the art accomplishes, it would be a sense of relaxation. This program is so good for giving the participants a chance to sit back and to relax and to explore their own thoughts and feelings. Sometimes this doesn&#39;t get done unless it is scheduled.&quot;<br />

&quot;I&#39;ve been leading groups for teenaged girls at an alternative high school. My focus has been to help them feel better about themselves no matter who they are or what their circumstances have been. I recently led a workshop in which the girls made some beautiful greeting cards. We put our names in a basket, and then drew randomly. Each of the girls ended up making a card for someone else. It was a pleasant surprise for everyone to discover all the positive and encouraging feelings that were in the group. I love leading workshops for teenagers. They feel so much pressure to appear strong and pulled together. The workshops give them an opportunity to be themselves, to open up and to feel. I love the way the art allows them that space to value who they are and who they&#39;re becoming in their young lives.&quot;<br />

&ldquo;I have been working to do long-term art processes with the women in long-term housing. I am using the opportunity to extend the art process to broader, deeper metaphors of themselves, others, and their worlds. They appear to take to this long -term work well, and working on a process over time seems to help their embodiment of the information they are making available to themselves. <br /><br />Projects so far have included felt doll-making (3-4 sessions), power shields (3 sessions), and stress bowls (3 sessions). I have seen great growth and awareness come from these women&mdash;surely it is a combination of the opportunities they have within the AWBW group and the work they are doing in other groups. <br /><br />For each of these long-term processes there is at least one story of a woman&#39;s personal beauty shining through&mdash;sometimes she sees it, other times I hold the hope that she will keep the work she has done so it can speak to her of her beauty at a time that she can hear.&quot;

Much more needs to be done to educate and stop this from happening. The issue is real and it is serious and it is still here&hellip;the &lsquo;work&rsquo; needs to continue!

&ldquo;I just led the Handprints workshop for the first time (1999 March Update). In it the women draw two hands: their own and their abuser&rsquo;s hand. I changed the workshop a little so that each woman had a big piece of paper and did both their hand drawings on that one paper. Then at the end we each ripped our paper in half, separating the hands. <br /><br />It was an intense workshop. We took a full half hour for sharing and that was very important. After all the sharing, I asked for each woman to share a positive word that they wanted to take with them from the workshop. We each shared our words in a circle and left on that positive note.&rdquo;<br /><br />

It&#39;s as if each woman&#39;s psyche puts out whatever she needs to see.<br /><br />And it&#39;s almost like they don&#39;t know what they&#39;ve done until they look at their finished artwork.<br /><br />That&#39;s my favorite part. It&#39;s like a lightbulb goes on.&quot;<br />

During our last Children&rsquo;s Leadership Training we led an old favorite workshop called &#39;The Monster in Me.&#39; One of our new leaders William Quintana, from Rainbow Children&rsquo;s Services had the following experience.<br /><br />&quot;Today when we did the &#39;Monster in Me&#39; workshop I remembered working with a new family that came to our shelter several months ago. The mother and her child were both bruised and it broke my heart to see them in such pain. <br /><br />Today I drew the monster that was in me when I saw them for the first time. I wondered what kind of monster could hurt this beautiful family. The way they looked haunted me ever since. When the workshop activity was over, we were asked if we wanted to share the experience of creating a monster. At first I did not want to share because it was too emotional, but then I told the story and I asked if I could tear up the drawing so I could finally get rid of that monster. The room, full of leaders, got very quiet as they watched me rip up the drawing and then they applauded! It felt good to let go of that monster in such a supportive environment.&quot;

All the kids sat in a circle and we read the book, &#39;What is Love?&#39; After this, we began to talk about all the aspects of love; what does love smell like, how is it shaped, what color is it? All the kids shared. <br /><br />One stated that love is black in color. When the whole group had shared we talked about the ideas. I asked Joseph why love was black. His response was very touching. He said, &#39;love is black because black is a color with a lot of depth, just like love.&#39; <br /><br />This allowed the group to talk about how common ideas and associations to colors and emotions are not always what we think. <br /><br />It was talked about with great enthusiasm and helped engage the kids. As Joseph stated, &#39;the depth of the color is black and can mean much more than just darkness.&#39;<br /></span><span class="TextHeader1"><span class="TextHeader2"><br /></span></span>

<span class="TextHeader1"><span class="plaintext">&quot;Journey Butterflies is one of my favorite activities and I make certain to complete it with each new student we receive. It is an activity that allows all of my students, kindergarten through 12th grade, to assess their situation and realize that just as a caterpillar can make a transformation and become something new, so too can they in their own lives. <br /><br />Even though every student is not willing to discuss their situation and what they would change along their journey, I can see each of them processing the information, figuring out what they will do differently in their futures. <br /><br />Additionally, they think it is the &#39;coolest&#39; to watch the shrinky dinks in the toaster oven and are always amazed and a bit relieved when it comes out new and better. (I&rsquo;m always relieved too...I keep waiting for the day when it sticks together instead of flattening back out).&quot;</span></span>

&quot;I do the art projects at times in my DV women&#39;s support group. One night we did the Encourgaging Stones project. <br /><br />I use small black shale stones that I collect from the beaches of Lake Erie. They are very smooth and easy to carry in hand or pocket. <br /><br />The women wrote empowering words on the stones and took them home with them. A few weeks later one of the group members (who hadn&#39;t been there for the stones&#39; project) was due in court the next morning and very anxious about seeing her abuser and the long wait to be called in. When group was over I noticed one of the members give her something. <br /><br />The following week she came to group and relayed that court had gone well and that even with the abuser staring at her and the long wait, she felt the power of the support group with her because she had taken the stone she had received from the group member last week and held it in her hand the whole time. This is the power of the art program at work!

She always looked forward to &#39;doing art.&#39;<br /><br />Initially she focused on the great projects, different mediums and time to be with her new friends.<br /><br />However, after months of going to group, she began to use it as an outlet to express her great sadness about not being with her father.<br /><br />The groups allowed her to have a safe place to talk about someone she wasn&#39;t supposed to talk to or see.<br /><br />She would always say, &#39;I can talk about him here.&#39;&quot;<br />

We even did the Dream Catcher workshop; he said &#39;they don&rsquo;t work!&#39; <br /><br />Then we did the Safe Rock workshop and he felt better! He could keep the rock under his pillow or his pocket where he could touch it. He talked about his fears and awful dreams and when he held his rock he closed his eyes and smiled and said &#39;when I dream at night, my rock is safe with me under my pillow and I can hold it tight.&#39;<br /><br />It really felt wonderful for me, as a leader, to help my little dream boy find a way though his fears and demons through touching and holding a rock. I really recommend this workshop. All the children love holding and painting the rocks.&rdquo;

&quot;When I teach the Journey Butterfly workshop I like to include Treasure Boxes so the children have a safe place to put the beautiful butterflies they create. I started the workshop by reading a story about butterflies. There was a 9-year-old girl in our group, who had moved around from home to home, shelter to shelter, hotel to hotel, and when we began working with the Shrinky Dink material she said, &#39;you know, I am like a butterfly &ndash; moving around all the time.&#39; While working on her butterfly she used all kinds of bright and happy colors in her design and said, &#39;this is how I feel.&#39; After she was finished we put the butterfly in the Treasure Box and I told her she could take it with her and when she moved from place to place, she could open the box to see the butterfly and remember how she felt. She couldn&rsquo;t believe she could keep it and said &#39;no one had ever given me anything before.&#39;<span class="TextHeader3"><span class="TextHeader2"><span class="TextHeader3"></span></span></span><br /><span class="TextHeader2"></span>

<![CDATA[
g, confident, and outgoing people. <br /><br />When I think about how children change when they come into Lydia Place, the child that comes to mind is three-year-old Aydan. <br /><br /> When Aydan first came to live at Lydia Place he was a handful, to say the least. Around the house and in children&rsquo;s group he was always screaming, crying, hitting his head on the wall, and throwing fits when he didn&rsquo;t get his way. This continued for about three months. Then changes started to happen with Aydan&rsquo;s behavior and the way he communicated with others. <br /><br />In children&rsquo;s group, it was apparent that he lacked social skills and boundaries. Other staff members and myself would work on teaching him appropriate boundaries and using his words instead of screaming and hitting others. Aydan now physically makes a bubble around his body with his hands when asked to give space to others. Also, Aydan loves to say &#39;my group&#39; to everyone on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Aydan knows that group is his time to play, do art, and learn how to express his feelings in a safe way. <br /><br />I know that it hasn&rsquo;t been easy for Aydan and his mom to live at Lydia Place. I know that it must be hard for his mom to raise a difficult child. I honor her for all the accomplishments she has made with her parenting skills. I also give a lot of praise to Aydan for absorbing all that he has learned in the past six months and putting these skills to use everyday. I am honored to witness these types of changes our families make during their six month stay at Lydia Place. I wouldn&rsquo;t change being a children&rsquo;s group leader for the world.&quot;</span></span>

<span class="plaintext" style="font-weight: normal">Art has become a valuable part of the holistic approach to cultural competency at Arctic Women in Crisis as they integrate traditional Inupiaq values into their programs.<br /><br />Windows leaders Ginny Walsh and Barbara Lippe share:<br /><br />&quot;Historically, many of AWIC&#39;s clients have been suspicious of the Western style group format which mainly utilizes talk therapy; some clients state that they are shy, worry about revealing too much of their personal history, or simply can&#39;t find the words to describe their experience. <br /><br />After one of the art projects the clients shared, &#39;Art in our culture is a way of expressing ourselves... The things we do let me express how I&#39;m really feeling inside. It&#39;s easier for me to express how I feel through my art than it is sitting around and talking.&#39; <br /><br />Another participant stated that, &#39;This art actually showed me my life before and after and how I can change.&#39; <br /><br />Ginny and Barbara also find that the art helps the children relax and engage. &#39;Children who have been traumatized often find it hard to express their feelings. But something as simple as drawing a picture can begin the healing.&#39; </span>

<span class="FinePrint"><span class="FinePrint"><span class="TextCaption"></span></span></span>Elka Kazmierczak asked the staff at The Women&#39;s Center in Illinois to brainstorm and share workshop ideas inspired by the children&#39;s book, <em>What Is Love?</em><br /><div style="text-align: justify"><div style="text-align: left"><br />Lori Wylie responded with these fun and important workshops.<br /><em><br />L-O-V-E Poems</em><br /><br />&quot;This workshop is a simple yet powerful way to allow participants to explore how they choose to define love. Each participant will create a L-O-V-E Poem by writing a sentence using each letter of the word love. First, have the children think of how they want the love in their life to be. What does it feel like, sound like and look like? Second, have the children write out the word L-O-V-E. Then put on soft music and depending on their age, have them do a journaling excercise or simply give children scratch paper and let them explore and experiment with different variations of their love poem.<br /></div><br /></div>While working on the Love Poem workshop a 17 yr. old client shared that her L-O-V-E poem showed her HER idea of what love is, rather than what her mother keeps telling her (ie., &quot;find a guy with lots of money&quot;)!<br /><br />Here are some more variations of the L-O-V-E poem that Lori developed: <br /><br />1. Make two hearts: a black or dark heart glued to the other side of the red one, and have survivors do the same type of L-O-V-E poems. On the dark side, using words or phrases to describe what their love/relationship was like &#39;before,&#39; and then on the red side would be the positive aspects of love that they have or want to have. That will help the survivors to think about how far they&#39;ve come in realizing what love really means and what they&#39;re looking for in the future.<br /><br />2. Use the L-O-V-E poems on hearts attached to handles that can be used during marching at Take Back the Night.&quot;<br /><span class="FinePrint"><br /></span>A note from Lori: &quot;Thank you for showing me how art can help these teens to express their feelings and look into thoughts they otherwise keep inside.&quot;<br />

life. Even though there was a period in my life in which there were only sorrows and humiliations, today I see my life full of light with a long road on which I roam with my three children, who give me life.&quot;<br /><br />Dark vs.Light: <br />&quot;The core of my tree that provides it with nourishment is love. I painted the heart brown, as love is the soil that feeds my tree. The tree is divided between darkness (negativity) and light (positivity). The black hole sun encompasses part of my tree in darkness. However, only the weak branches are affected. The stronger branches live in the light and do not allow the darkness to take their strength. The beautiful, bright blue sky dominates the picture, as positivity will always be more powerful than negativity. My trees and branches are jagged, imperfect, and unique, like me. At the center of my tree is an image that represents all of my incredible Wings clients. The figure is purple, as domestic violence is the tie that binds us together, and has wings, as I view them as my earthly angels. It is my angels that remind me every day that it&#39;s my choice to live in darkness or light.&quot;<br /><br />My Life Unfolding, Moving from fear to passionate possibilities:<br />&quot;Fire-charred roots and trunk represent betrayal, hurt, distrust - they represent me. Door half closed, fear peeking through - it represents me. Blooms are what is to become - they represent me. Fallen leaves changing colors as time nurtures new life - they represent me. They&#39;re swinging to passionate possibilities.&quot; <br /><br />The Lonely One:<br />&quot;In a world of beauty, the Lonely One stands out. The Lonely One is isolated, followed by a black cloud, too deep in its sorrows to be able to see the beauty within reach.&quot;<br /><br /> Tree of Love:<br />&quot;No matter how bad things start off, the love will make you a stronger person and shine your true colors.&quot; <br /><br />Trying to Stand Strong:<br />&quot;Trying to stand on my own feet, trying to keep a smile on my face. Trying real hard to let my ugly past be in the past and live for today with God in my life and my wonderful children. I will one day stand strong.&quot; <br /><br />Starting to Bloom by J.B.:<br />&quot;The roots are the abuse but I&#39;m starting to rise above all the violence, and with God&#39;s help (the sun), I will be stronger than before.&quot;<br />

&quot;The children at our shelter cannot wait for Friday - everyday they ask me, &#39;Can we do Windows today?&#39; I remind them that Windows is Friday - they say, &#39;but if you let us do Windows today, we can skip Friday.&#39; Every Friday the children start to line up right after breakfast at 7:30 even though the program doesn&#39;t start until 9:00!!!<br /><br />The older girls even wanted to come back from overnight camp a day early so they wouldn&#39;t miss Windows on Friday! But I promised them I would come in on Saturday so they wouldn&#39;t miss out.<br /><br />One young boy was partnered with a newcomer to the shelter. The new child was scared and crying, the slightly older boy was trying to comfort him and said, &#39;Just wait til Friday when we have Windows - everything will be all right then.<br /><br />One day at nap time a three-year-old asked me, &#39;Did you know that my dad hits me?&#39; I told him that I didn&#39;t know that. He then said, &#39;I learned at Windows that it was okay for me to tell you.&#39; He then rolled over and slept for four hours, the first time he slept well since he came to the shelter.<br /><br />Because of the Windows Program, the children are more focused and can follow rules so much better. Windows has allowed the children to go deeoper into their feelings and have made our other programs more successful. They seem to feel safe emotionally and safe talking about themselves. We are even able to introduce self-esteem workshops for the first time because the children are more open and receptive.&quot;<br /><br />

&quot;A parentified child, this boy found the art workshops to be a time when he was not expected to take care of his brother and sister. Having been a witness to domestic violence, he was ready to use this opportunity - the art workshops - to express and process his feelings. When his family left the shelter, he gave me this prayer that he had written.&quot;<br /><br /><em>I pray thee o&#39; lord<br />that our father&#39;s sins<br />do not flow<br />through our blood,<br />so we can reach<br />a higher plan with you. </em><br />

&quot;Three Wishes is one of my favorite workshops to try when I know I&#39;ll be able to really talk with the kids. I love seeing the way the art can create a dialogue, and I love giving the kids these opportunities to work through issues.<br /><br />At one workshop, the Three Wishes gave a family of kids a chance to work through their feelings about having just been stopped by the police and having their car towed away. I could see how unsettled they were since it had just happened that day, abd the art helped them get more comfortable with their situation.<br /><br />At another Three Wishes workshop, a lttle girl said, &#39;I wish my dad were on Jupiter!&#39; I encouraged her to go ahead and draw it. She drew different planets, with herself, her mom, and her siblings on another planet far far away from her dad on Jupiter. I could see her working through some of her frustration about him.&quot;<br />

&quot;One highlight of mine was seeing a little boy use the art to break through the secrecy that surrounded the difficulties in his family. He struggled with such a sense of secrecy that he found it hard to even talk about what he was going through. When we did a Cray-Pas workshop, he drew a picture of his family now and another picture of his family how he wants it to be in the future. It went from black to a rainbow. It was so rewarding to see him find a safe way to express himself and have some relief from keeping it bottled up inside.&quot;<br />

&quot;One client was always very quiet about her inner feelings, especially regarding family issues, but with time, the workshops eventually helped her be able to talk about these difficult feelings...<br /><br />They expressed their feelings about their family and their place in it, through their art - without words...<br /><br />It was effective, seeing how the boys (ages 3 and 9) really got their anger out in a constructive way...<br /><br />One participant was able to wish positive things for herself in the past, present, and future and talk about it...<br /><br />We found significant growth in our teenage clients due to the AWBW workshops which quickly enabled them to become more comfortable about opening up their feelings...&quot;<br />

&quot;When Doreen and I led the Dream Catchers workshop recently we brought in some extra things to make the session special. We had a Navajo rug to sit on and a feather to use as a &#39;talking feather.&#39; We started by sitting in a circle on the rug to share our thoughts about dreams.<br /><br />As we passed the feather around, whoever had the talking feather could speak. We played Navajo flute music in the background throughout the workshop (The music was from R. Carlos Nakai. Thanks to Noreen for doing research via the internet to find the music and other info to help us set the atmosthere of the workshop!). I also brought in some dream catcher earrings to show the kids.<br /><br />All of this made the workshop extra fun and special for all of us. I think it helps our projects go well when we focus and build around a theme like that.&quot;<br />

&quot;They brought in a client who had experienced a great deal of domestic violence growing up, including verbal abuse.&nbsp; The art sessions were her favorite and I was asked to give her an extra art project to keep her focused.&nbsp; In three months time, I was amazed, and so was the staff, in how Window&#39;s truly opened up her world, allowing her to experience both tears and laughter.&quot;<br />

&quot;This year the women and children in the shelter made a huge valentine for us to bring to the state legislators for the 2007 Domestic Violence Legislative Day, at the state capitol.<br /><br />We did the Windows workshop called Healing Hearts, making three hearts each - one each for the past, present, and future. It was very hard for the participants to give up their work since they had put so much into their creations, but they understood how important it was to tell their stories, so they decided to let us take the valentine as long as we could bring it back. So that is what we did.<br /><br />The women and children were so proud of their work, and the exercise was very powerful and meaningful to them. Each heart told detailed stories of where they had been emotionally and physically and where they were going. The stories were moving and extremely revealing.<br /><br />When we arrived with the huge valentine and displayed it, we felt it was the best display there! We were all so proud to have it and to exhibit the stories behind each of the hearts.<br /><br />It showed us how powerful the workshops are and how they give a voice that can be shared to impact others. The day was exciting for all of us.&quot;<br />

&quot;There were two brothers, ages 9 and 13, that came into the shelter acting like they were 20. When they first arrived, it was so rough that we had to call the authorities for help with the 9-year-old because he was really upset. He didn&rsquo;t want to be there. He wanted to be with his dad and he saw his mom as his enemy. Every other word that came out of his mouth was a cuss word. The art workshops were the only time you could tell he and his brother were kids. <br /><div align="left"><br />The art gave us a way to build trust and really connect with the boys. The art was huge. We did both individual and group art sessions with them including Shrinky Dinks, Treasure Boxes and Dream Pillows. The day he left the shelter, the 9-year-old was carrying around his dream pillow. He had written on it &lsquo;I love my mom,&rsquo; and he was carrying it around with him all day like a security blanket or stuffed animal.<br /><br />We are a 45-day shelter. We have such a short time to do so much - to help the kids handle what they&rsquo;ve seen and been through. The art really gives us a way to get to know them, build trust, and help them do the emotional work they have on their plates.&quot;<br /></div>

&ldquo;One of my clients, that I will call &#39;Sue&#39;, started coming to AWBW groups and started to come to individual sessions where we worked on processing her shame, anger, pain, and resentments. Sue&rsquo;s sister was working with the protective services agency to adopt Sue&rsquo;s child. The more obvious this became, the angrier my client presented hersef in court.<br /><br />Here&#39;s where the magic begins. Sue and I decided that she needed a mantra...her mantra was <br />&#39;I AM worthy and capable of raising my daughter. I WILL raise my daughter in a healthy home when I get out of prison.&#39; We then started visualizing what that would look like and Sue began designing her <em>Vision Map</em> and other exercises around her being healthy and whole. <br /><br />Sue presented her new attitude and vision in every meeting, in every courtroom, with every caseworker... including her sister. The calmer Sue became the angrier her sister became and the nicer the protective agency caseworkers, judges, state&rsquo;s attorneys, and public defenders became towards Sue. The judge proclaimed that he rarely sees everything fall in place like this case did. Sue will raise her child after she pays her consequences.<br /><br />This program and what it has to offer victims of domestic violence is beyond unbelievable. Since she has begun to serve her sentence she has been sharing group exercises done in our AWBW group with her Positive Attitude group offered in prison... the group is going to be doing <em>Inside/Outside</em> at one of their next classes. <br /><br />She is sharing the love and joy of these groups. They are just magic.&rdquo;

&quot;We saw a big improvement with a 10-year-old boy. He came in full of anger and not willing to cooperate. He thought everything was &lsquo;stupid&rsquo; and threw us a lot of attitude. <br /><br />Every day our mission was to be reassuring to him. With positive workshops, patience and love, we saw him change his low self-esteem to a positive self-image. <br /><br />During the &lsquo;Creating a Safe Place&rsquo; workshop, he shared a lot with me about things that happened around his home. His home was not a safe place and that workshop gave him a way to share about the things he had been through. <br /><br />He smiles more now and before he left the shelter, he told us that the art groups were the ones that helped him release what he needed to release.&quot;

Blanca is 29 years old and has a 4 year old son who has autism. She had previously been at another shelter but returned to her abuser out of loneliness and her desire to believe that he was going to keep his promises to change. Her abuser kept her locked in their apartment with their son, only letting her go out to help him sell tamales or to take their son to his weekly therapy sessions. He did not allow her to go to school or work.<br /><br />When she came to Haven House she was very dejected and sad. Although willing to work hard to begin a new life, she was also very shy and quiet. During our groups she was quiet, only speaking up when she felt strongly about something or when wanting to share a personal experience. Only during our Window&#39;s workshops, both group and individual sessions, would she smile and laugh. After the first workshop she gave us a brilliant smile and shared &quot;I love art, it makes me feel free.&quot;<br /><br />The first individual Window&#39;s workshop we did (Turning Over A New Leaf ) I saw a pronounced change in Blanca. She looked more relaxed and happy. When I shared my observation she stated, &quot;Creating art is my escape. When I am doing art I feel calm, as if I can do anything....even forget the past.&quot;<br /><br />During a Parenting group Blanca participated in the &quot;Unmasking Me/Unmasking the Future &quot; workshop creating a simple yet beautiful mask that she described as containing &quot;the hidden woman who was hiding from life due to shame and hurt.....who wanted to burst free and runaway.&quot; The comment she wrote for that workshop was &quot;representa a la mujer que se esconde bajo un antifaz por miedo de entrentar la realidad en la que vive.&quot; Which translates into &quot;it represents the woman who is hiding underneath a mask due to fear in facing the reality in which she lives in.&quot;<br /><br />Blanca shared during our sessions how she feels lighter and more at peace and how she&#39;s changed and how her art reflects that change.

<![CDATA[
Our metro office began holding AWBW art groups in the beginning of 2008.&nbsp; Recently, a twenty-seven year old Latina girl began receiving case management and counseling services from Peace Over Violence and quickly joined our art group.&nbsp; She had been molested then raped by two stepfathers for over 12 years, her mother and siblings would yell at her, tell her that she was stupid, hit her and tell her that they didn&#39;t love her because she had a mental disability.&nbsp; She decided to call the police and report what was happening to her, which brought her to Peace Over Violence. <br /><br />When she first began to attend the art groups, she was quiet, timid and appeared depressed. The first couple of weeks that she attended, she did not want to participate in the discussion, and did not want other participants to look at her art projects. Because the art groups are designed to use art projects as a method of communicating her trauma, experiences and feelings about the assault, she had the opportunity to express, through her drawings, and we began to see a change in her creations and in her personal life as well. <br /><br />In the first sessions she attended, she would use dark colors in her drawings and would describe her them as &lsquo;black holes that she could not get out of.&rsquo;&nbsp; Every week the workshops differ, and she began to show through her projects that she is very creative.&nbsp; During the art closing circles, she said that she was grateful AWBW groups existed and felt that the groups were more than helpful in her healing process. The art group facilitators along with Deaf, Disabled, and Elderly Services worked together to help empower and support her through the healing process, and through the various stages of the criminal and civil case against her mother and stepfather.<br /><br />Today, this client&#39;s stepfather is in jail and her mother no longer has custody of her. Through art, she is able to express her past and now her hopeful future!

After attending the Women&#39;s Leadership training, Mary Claire set some goals for her windows group including doing a staff workshop, getting the word out about the workshops, and starting a 10-week workshop series. She also set out&nbsp; to offer a safe, comfortable, and creative environment for the women to share. After a lot of hard work and dedication this is what she and her co-facilitators experienced.<br /><br />&quot;Looking back over the past 11 weeks, we all agreed that because they were so open and honest with one another, it allowed the women to form a safe community. <br /><br />The final two projects, Journey Butterflies and Revealing Our Beauty and Power , were both very beautiful workshops to end our fall season.&nbsp; The workshops were equally effective and rewarding for both the clients and the facilitators.<br /><br />&nbsp;On our last day of group, the women spoke about how the workshops allowed them to relax and feel comfortable; how it allowed them to open up to one another and share; how much fun they had creating the different projects, and how much they want to come back and continue participating in the art group next year. <br /><br />One of the many great experiences I had was witnessing one woman release the shame she felt about being a survivor of domestic violence. Once she was able to open up, her story poured out of her. As the woman continued to tell her story even after the group ended, I realized that she was no longer ashamed, but rather empowered by her story, and the potential for her story to make a difference in someone else&#39;s life.<br /><br />If the art group allowed one woman to free herself from the guilt and shame that silenced her for so long, then we know that we are teaching women that they can, in fact, redefine their lives and truly free themselves from the cycle of violence from the abuse that they once knew.

Stephanie is a new Children&#39;s Leader from the YWCA Pierce County in Washington, she shares these stories:<br /><br />A little girl (3 years old) had an amazing experience during her first Windows workshop.<br /><br />&quot;Having witnessed her mother being abused by her father, the child had a difficult time leaving her mother&#39;s or her sister&#39;s side.&nbsp; As anticipated, the first time she came to a Windows group alone, she started to cry. <br /><br />I asked her if she wanted to make a very special messy project with me, she said &quot;yes&quot; without hesitating!&nbsp; Once she saw all the art supplies I had set up she looked at me with her wide eyes and asked &quot;we&#39;re gonna use ALL this stuff?&quot;<br /><br />From the moment she sat down, it was like magic.&nbsp; She began covering her canvas with various supplies and sought out reassurance by asking me &quot;You mean it&#39;s okay if I get paint on the table?&nbsp; No one is gonna get mad at us? What about my hands? Can I get it on my hands too?&quot; After I confirmed that she was really free to make a mess she began to assure me by saying &quot;there&#39;s paint on the table but it&#39;s okay cause we&#39;re not gonna get in trouble.&quot;<br /><br />I was amazed to see this COMPLETE change takeover this 3-year-old&nbsp; little girl.&nbsp; When her mother came back to get her she told her mom &quot;Nope I don&#39;t want to go!&quot;&nbsp; I think her mom was as amazed as I was!<br /><br />Now when I see her she always reassures me that I&#39;m allowed to get messy and no one will hurt me because of it!&quot;<br /><br />Another girl had a break through experience, this is her story.<br /><br />&nbsp; &quot;In early October, an 8 year old girl who spoke limited English, entered our shelter program with her mother.&nbsp; From the moment they came to the program it was obvious that the little girl was very quiet and reluctant to speak English.<br /><br />She participated in the art in her first Windows workshop, but did not speak. After that first workshop, much to my surprise, the girl not only participated in as many workshops as she could, but she also started talking to the other children.<br /><br />As we assisted her in finding her voice, I soon discovered that she had much better language skills than we thought.<br /><br />The art enabled her to open up and become more confident.&nbsp; Now she is willing to try new things and even verbally defends herself if another child criticizes or teases her.&quot;<br /><br />I truly attribute these stories to the AWBW workshops!&quot;

Our agency has been using Windows in our children&#39;s support groups for almost six months now. I have seen significant growth in the children, especially the ones who come to group on a regular basis.<br /><br />There are two children (brother and sister) that really illustrate what Windows is all about. Their family started coming to our groups in December. The first time we met the children, they were both very shy. The little boy said that he did not like art and he was no good at it. His sister said she loved art but was still hesitant to participate.<br /><br />During their first couple of groups, they were inseparable and stayed pretty quiet. We did not force them to participate, but with each group, they both started to open up and become involved in what the group was doing.<br /><br />In the last 3 months, there has been such a complete turn around. These two children are the first to welcome new children into the group and to tell them how much fun it is. They create some of the most beautiful artwork and they are very proud of everything they create.<br /><br />They are also more comfortable sharing about their past home experiences about their dad hurting their mom. I truly believe that their participation in Windows workshops has helped them along their way towards healing.<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago, the children&#39;s mother informed us that after she finished her group, they would be moving to another state. She said the children did not take it very well and that they told her they wanted to stay here and still come to &quot;class&quot; every week. It is bittersweet to see this family leave, but we know that their mother is finally getting the freedom she deserves and making a better life for herself and her children.<br /><br />To reassure the children and their mother, we gave them a list of DV agencies in the area where they are moving, so that they can continue attending support groups.<br /><br />I will never forget when the little girl came up to me and asked, &quot;will they have people like you guys and fun art projects like we do here?&quot; I am thankful for Windows coming into our support groups, and helping children, like the two in this story, to have something to look forward to every week.<br /><br />

Daniel Yi at the Center for the Pacific Asian Family generously shared this story about his experiences with a child who had suffered trauma and was hard to reach.<br /><br />&quot;I worked with a four-year-old girl who had witnessed her mother being abused by her father ever since she was born. &nbsp;<br /><br />Since entering the shelter, she was not able to communicate her emotions. However, the AWBW workshops enabled me to communicate with her via art.&nbsp; For example, the little girl had trouble eating, so I had her draw pictures of different types of food that she likes to eat.&nbsp; This helped improve her eating habits and allowed her some freedom in her food choices.<br /><br />Many times, the girl would talk about her father, who she sees once a week, but would not go into detail about him.&nbsp; She would draw her father holding hands with her and a balloon in her other hand, and she would say that she misses her father. <br /><br />I learned that this little girl did not understand the concept of saying good-bye.&nbsp; So when she and her mother left the shelter I gave her drawings of our staff saying good-bye to her.<br /><br />Without the art we would have not been able to connect with each other in such a positive manner. The art actually allowed me to understand her feelings better and helped her&nbsp; to express her emotions.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<![CDATA[
<div align="center"><span class="TextHeader2"></span> Imagine living in a rural community in Alaska that only has 14 school age children and 37 adults and the only way in or out of town is by boat or small plane. This is only one of the communities that the Cordova Family Resource Center commutes to, bringing the residents art projects every 6-8 weeks.<br /><br />&nbsp;I started working for CFRC in April of this year. Already it has been an amazing journey. I had never been to Chenega Bay before and in June I was able to go with our Executive Director, Nicole Songer. <br /><br />As we were in the plane&nbsp; getting ready to land I could feel the excitement within me. I was curious about the residents there, curious to know if they were excited to see us, wondering if they were happy to have us come into their small community. <br /><br />We had to walk up to the building we would be in. Our 4 large boxes of art supplies were taken up with a <br />4- wheeler by a resident, who kindly loaded and unloaded them for us. <br /><br />We planned to do Shrink Dink Footprint Book Markers and Driftwood Dream Catchers.&nbsp; As we set out on a walk to collect driftwood for our project, the children started to open up to us. Some talked about family problems, some talked about their ups and downs of living in a small community. I was amazed at how the problems of a small village of 50 were the same problems as those of an urban city. The difference is that everyone in a village seems to know about everyone elses problems. It seemed like because of this, the children opened up to us a lot more than a child living in an urban area would. One girl in particular caught my attention; she was by my side most of our walk to and from the seashore. She was telling me all about her family, the problems they had, how she wished some things could change, and how she wished her mother would stop drinking and smoking. She said it gets bad enough sometimes that she has to stay with her grandmother. You could see the sadness in her eyes at times. She kept saying that she was so happy that we were there to do art projects with them. Other children would agree that us coming out there was always so much fun. <br /><br />As we did our Shrinky Dink project, the children were amazed how the toaster oven shrunk their beautifully decorated artwork! &nbsp; Since they didn&rsquo;t have a toaster oven in the village, we left ours so they could do more projects like these after we were gone. They children glowed with excitement. <br /><br />As we were leaving Chenega Bay, I reflected upon what I saw that day. I was truly inspired by how much AWBW means to these children and those villages we try to visit every 6 weeks. I imagine how it makes those little hearts swell with excitement when they hear us land, or how they sink when we can&rsquo;t make it in due to weather. Feeling content with our visit, I started brainstorming about projects for the next visit. Without AWBW we would not be able to bring such a fantastic program out to villages like Chenega Bay and Tatitlek. We would not be able to reach out to these children who need us. Without AWBW, I would have never known the true meaning of touching the heart of a child. It has enlightened their lives, but furthermore, it has enlightened mine. <br />Thank you AWBW! <br /></div>

<div align="center">As an AWBW leader, and the supervisor for an education and prevention program called &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Not Ok&rdquo;, Christina Eslava visits high schools to teach teens about dating violence and healthy relationships.&nbsp; In accordance with their efforts to increase teen awareness regarding domestic violence, Christina&rsquo;s employer, Haven House, hosted their annual &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Not Ok&rdquo; Teen Dating Violence Art Exhibit.&nbsp; The artwork featured in the exhibit was created entirely by teens that attended Christina&rsquo;s dating violence classes.&nbsp; <br /><br />The goal of one of the projects was to use any medium, to educate the viewer about domestic violence.&nbsp; The exhibit also featured paper mache&prime; &ldquo;<a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2729&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=speak+out&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0">Speak Out Masks</a> &rdquo; made by teens that used a &ldquo;<a href="/awbw/u/childrensupdates/feelings_faces.pdf">Feeling Face&#39;s</a>&rdquo; chart to help identify and channel their feelings into the art.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Speak Out Masks&rdquo; project was so effective that Christina described the words written by the teens that accompany the masks as &ldquo;overwhelming.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this setting, participants were able to discuss taboo subjects, de-buff stereotypes, and reinforce the concept that men are also victims of abuse.&nbsp; <br /><br />Christina usually encounters a lot of teens that are intimidated by art when she first introduces the projects.&nbsp; To counter this resistance, she advised them to go home and simply cut out words or pictures from magazines to create a collage that will teach other teens about domestic violence.&nbsp; <br /><br />Christina&rsquo;s program was so effective she gave each teenager a resource page that included information about AWBW&rsquo;s program and website.&nbsp; The AWBW projects were not only effective for the teens who participated in the workshops, but their parents as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the exhibit, Christina spoke to the parents regarding how AWBW opens up lines of communication about abuse.&nbsp; After viewing the art, the parents were amazed at what their children had created and learned about domestic violence.&nbsp; Many of the parents also thanked Christina for opening up lines of communication about this important topic that they had never discussed with their teens. <br /><br /><div align="center">Christina has received a large amount of positive feedback regarding her work with the teens. After one of her teen dating violence workshops, a male attendee approached her and asked her &ldquo;how does it feel to save another person&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;&nbsp; This particular comment really affected Christina in a personal way since she had a friend who lost her life as a result of teen dating violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></div><br />Christina loves her job and gets so much out of talking to and running workshops with the teens.&nbsp; By utilizing AWBW projects she is able to help teens learn about healthy relationships, break their silence about abuse, and increase public awareness about this important topic.&nbsp; </div><br /><br /><br /><br />

This month&#39;s workshop, <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2828&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=god&amp;submit.x=25&amp;submit.y=3">God&#39;s Eye</a> came to us from Mark Kroll, at Feather River Tribal Health. Below you&#39;ll find 3 more of Mark&#39;s Native American inspired creative contributions. Thank you Mark for your fantastic ideas!<br /><br />The first is a story to share with the children for the <strong><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2690&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=dream+cat&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0">Dream Catcher</a> </strong>(Children&#39;s Manual) workshop that Windows offers. It goes like this, &quot;Originally dream catchers were made with a red bead in the center representing the Spider God. The Spider God decides which dreams are good and which are bad. The bad ones are caught in the net and evaporate when the sun comes up. The good dreams go down through the strings and feathers to the dreamer.&quot; Kids like these because they like the idea of someone watching out for them.<br /><br />The second we would like to share is a <strong>Talking Stick </strong>workshop. Mark says that these can be as simple or complex as you would like to make them. They can be sticks or small branches or pieces of wood, detailed with rawhide, carved, beaded with plastic beads, decorated with abalone or leather lacing, or just drawn on with colored markers &ndash; you can use whatever you have. Mark usually starts by asking the kids if they&#39;ve heard of them. He explains that this is a talking circle, and that we take turns. The talking stick stays with the person whose turn it is to talk until that person is finished. He uses the activity to talk about respect, empathy, and patience and finds it is helpful for kids with short attention spans and reminds them not to interrupt others.<br /><br />The third is called <strong>Counting Coup</strong>. This is a workshop to address kids&rsquo; fears and is based on the Sioux practice of &quot;counting coup&quot;, or marking your enemy&rsquo;s home or horse with your hand print as a way to show bravery. Kids trace their hands on construction paper of various colors and cut out the shapes. They write down a fear on each hand print. They then make a wreath by gluing the hand prints in a circle around a paper plate, with their fears facing the back. The idea is that you know that your fears are there, but others don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a way to release fears. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Windows leader, Vanessa Fabricatore, was kind enough to share this story about her experiences with her Windows workshops.<br /><br />&quot;I have been involved in the Windows program and doing workshops for about nine months.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m constantly amazed every time I do a workshop and see

the tremendous growth within each child. I feel so privileged that I&rsquo;m able to be a part of and witness the changes occurring in the children.<br /><br />Since the start of the workshops the children seemed hesitant to share their feelings and unsure if they could trust the others in the group. However now they not only feel like this is a safe place to express themselves, but they have created a special bond with each other.<br /><br />All the children have come so far but one 5-year-old child in particular has exceeded all my expectations. He is the youngest of four siblings and he was a wild child. There would be days where he was visibly very upset and would begin to fight with his brothers and on some days would throw toys, movies, and use foul language. However as time passed things began to change. <br /><br />It&rsquo;s been months since he has had an outburst and now he uses the workshops as an outlet for releasing his anger.<br /><br />One particular workshop we did, Feeling Friends, we were talking about the different feelings people can feel and he said, &quot;I get really angry some times and I don&#39;t know what to do about it&quot;. After we were done making our Feeling Friends he said, &quot;Now I can use my Feeling Friend at home when I get angry and I can share it with mommy.&quot;<br /><br />It touched me that the Windows workshops are more then just art projects to the children they are healing tools that they can utilize at home. &quot;

Sarah Stidham from TESSA in Colorado has been a Children&rsquo;s Leader for one full year. She really values her Windows training and loves holding workshops. During the time that Sarah has worked with her clients she has seen great change in the children. They have begun to recognize their feelings and gained the ability to speak out about them, they&#39;ve been allowed to internally explore who they are and to feel safe to express themselves, and they have learned to appreciate their moms within their challenging family circumstances.<br /><br />Sarah has also noticed that the workshops lets the kids be kids, and the children feel great being allowed to use their imagination and be messy!<br />Sarah&rsquo;s tells us about her 3 favorite workshops:<br /><br />Speak Out Masks (10/2005):<br />I think this is my favorite workshop. The children always enjoy it, no matter what age, and I think it is one of the most powerful workshops. It is such a great chance for the children to engage their inner process as well as find their inner voice. I love watching the children do this activity. The process of making the masks engages the children at a deep level and sometimes they are very quiet while they work on their masks and reflect. It seems as if their whole beings are taken into a safe place of healing by this creative process. The words from one teen&rsquo;s mask were &ldquo;I will not stay quiet. I am beautiful, strong and there is nothing more you can do to hurt me.&rdquo; It was during this workshop that I realized how powerful the art is.<br /><br />Sand Painting (5/2007):<br />This is a great workshop for me to do one-on-one. I think the medium of the sand and the uniqueness of this project really engages the children. One eight year old really learned to focus and was able to reflect on his life seeing clearly where he had been and where he was going. He worked hard to balance the good and bad in his life by mapping them out evenly. He was very proud to show me the different places he had been on his map and the places he wanted to go. We were also able to talk about how the happy places and the sad or angry places on his map affected him.<br /><br />Empathy Coupons (12/2000):<br />I was excited to find this workshop on the website, I thought it was a brilliant way to teach empathy as it is a very important piece of building resiliency in children, but also very difficult to impart, plus it is a way to teach about how to end the cycle of violence.<br /><br />The children were 7 and 8 years old. As they brainstormed about what special things they could do for their moms, some said hugs, help with chores or a massage; one child thought a trip to Disney World would be a nice way to show appreciation! The children took a great deal of time and care in creating the coupons and were so proud to give them to their moms. It was amazing to see the children begin to think of others and how they have the ability to affect others as well as to express appreciation inspite of the anger they may be feeling.<br /><br />

Chris is 16 now. When he was at United Methodist Youthville before he was 14, almost 15. He is a typical kid except for his anger issues and his violent family background. Chris attended AWBW groups since we started them, 2 years ago. He hated group to put it mildly. Every week it was a struggle to engage him and keep him in the room let alone get him to make art. After a few months he began to sit quietly in the group but still refused to create any art work. 2 weeks prior to his discharge he drew his first picture in group - it was a a broken house with crumbling walls and broken windows. He threw the picture out on the way out the door.<br /><br />About a year past and Chris returned to the campus after having lost a foster family placement. He saw me at another activity and immediately asked when AWBW would meet again.<br /><br />Although surprised, I was also eager to see Chris and what he would do in group. He not only participated in the group but he was engaged in conversation and art making. He now is a huge encouragement to other clients and is creating art at every group.<br /><br />Chris recently shared with me that he now feels like a real artist and enjoys using art as a coping tool. This is one of the many stories that is a testament to the effectiveness of the great program AWBW built.&quot;

There have been so many moments of children and teens sharing extremely personal, painful thoughts and feelings as well as glorious idealism, hopes and wishes for their futures.<br /><br />The Windows sessions have brought on tears, happy laughter, and even anger and rage, a time or two.&nbsp; I am continually amazed by how quickly a child or teenager reveals something of him or herself, feelings, fears dreams--to me: as a new advocate, through the art process as opposed to the more traditional talk therapy approach.<br /><br />I am thankful for the Windows program for many reasons, but I&#39;d like to mention here, that before the support and training from A Window Between Worlds, I was hesitant to use the art approaches and activities in my social work practice, in part because I was not a trained art therapist. While I understand that art therapy is something different, and that those art therapy professionals are trained in a particular way to use art materials with different ways and different theories of approach to treatment; I also feel more confident, that I too am a trained professional, who is very capable of using different modes of communication with the program participants that I serve.<br /><br />Art is not for art therapists only! My increased confidence and support to experiment (safely) has come from having the benefit of Window&#39;s programs&#39; years of experience in working with this particular population in this way.<br /><br />I also want to mention that I appreciate, very much, the Windows macro approach to sharing the good work that is being done in California with the rest of us around the country. I in turn, am doing what I can to share with other domestic violence professionals in Arizona, the great service and opportunity you have to offer them. This is such a needed service. Rarely is there offered an opportunity like this one, that benefits and supports the shelter administration, program planners, shelter workers and program participants. In addition, it is virtually free to us through your generous scholarship and free art supply program.... There is nothing like it!<br />Many thanks.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen children who were very shy come to the shelter, and after Windows group, they come out and feel more connected to other kids and with how they feel. They soon realize that they aren&#39;t the only ones going through what they are going through.&quot;

We had a three-year-old boy who had a speech impairment. He would only communicate by sound and pointing at objects or specific things he wanted. All of us at the children&#39;s center worked really hard with him. The form of abuse that his family experienced was isolation. They weren&#39;t allowed to go outside or talk to anyone. He was very anti-social since he never had the opportunity to interact with children or adults. Each time he was addressed, he would put his head down in embarrassment. After working with him constantly with the art groups, he started coming around; when he would speak, it was understandable. He was able to share and play with other children and he knew his shapes and colors very well. Even his mom noticed the difference in his behavior and a big change he had made. Mom appreciated everything we did to help her and her family.

s of excitement, apprehensiveness and thought to myself, &quot;would these workshops really help? Would they be the tool to help me gain insight, access and empathy into what their minds thought, their hearts felt and what their tiny eyes had seen?&quot;<br /><br />The answer was YES! The effect that the windows workshop had on the children in just that one day was astonishing. One child disclosed that he had been sexually abused, another child revealed his intense desire to take revenge on his father for hurting his family, and a teenage girl changed her mind frame from being helpless to an outlook of courage, strength and determination to become a successful professional despite her difficult home life.<br /><br />This was the first group that I facilitated. I used the &ldquo;A Book About Me&rdquo; workshop and formulated it to be used effectively for both the young ones and the older children.<br /><br />I was shocked that so much valuable information in each of these children had come from that one workshop.<br /><br />I left work that day with a new sense of hope for helping the children who come to Laura&rsquo;s House. The children who did disclose the information expressed feelings of validation and importance.<br /><br />When working with the children so much time and patience is needed in order for the child to just feel comfortable. When that time comes I will be ready with some amazing workshops/tools provided through Windows that can help them be heard.

Marsha Elzea from the Roundhouse Council in Plumas County which is in Northern California talked to us about the &quot;Moonlight&quot; fire they had last month and how the art affected the children at her agency.<br /><br />Marsha said that the flames could be seen from the windows of her agency and the fire was less than 7 miles away. Most of the families had to evacuate their homes and when the children came to her group they were very upset. She had them all draw pictures of what the fire looked like, and then they talked about what they were feeling.<br /><br />The children had lots of questions about what was happening and why, they were worried about what would happen to all the animals and their homes, they were scared, angry and confused.<br /><br />Being able to draw gave them the opportunity to release some of their fears and confused feelings. &ldquo;They were able to get their worries out on the paper.&rdquo; Because the families were so busy dealing with the evacuation, the children&rsquo;s emotional needs seemed to become secondary.<br /><br />The art made a tremendous difference for them. One child drew a rabbit running from flames, one drew fire and rain, another showed flames taking over the mountains. They were all so worried when they arrived but each left with a smiling face. It made Marsha feel so good that she was able to give the children something that they needed during this traumatic time.<br /><br />The next week they all made a big banner with their hand prints and messages of thanks to the local firefighters. Marsha hung the banner where the firefighters could see it. This gave the children a real sense of pride that they could help and give thanks to their heroes! One Child wrote &quot;I saw an angel and thought of you. Thank you!&quot;<br /><br />

&quot;I have been working with one of our off site emergency shelters that has a family of five children age 9 to 15. I did Windows workshops with them once a week before they started back to school. The art seemed to provide a safety zone for the children where they feel free to discuss things about their dad from both their past and present. These children are highly creative and unique in the art they produce. After each session they do a show for their mother to introduce the project they made and what it meant to them.<br /><br />We did the workshop Inside/Outside (4/2001) and the kids all felt like they were<br />exploring themselves in a way they never had before and they revealed things they hadn&#39;t shared to others before. They were surprised about what they shared and they discovered that it is okay to have secrets, it is okay to have private thoughts and it is okay to share those thoughts and secrets with people they feel safe with.<br /><br />Our shelter relies heavily on the Windows program as it gives a plan of how to use art to get the children to deal with some of the harder issues. The children know my passion for the arts, but it really helps to have the support from Window&#39;s to keep doing art with the children in every group and opening up window&#39;s to their soul.&quot;

Lately I have been working with more teens, they seem to come in with an attitude and some have picked up some of the characteristics of the abuser in the family.<br /><br />This one boy did not want to do art at all but we were working on the Debut CD (September 2004) and he got into it. I helped him look online for images and he really liked that too. Now he actually asks to come back<br />so we make special arrangements for him to come in the day after his visits with his dad. The next time we were together we created Pride Medallions (January 2005). After his visit with dad he was feeling very negative but the Pride Medallions made him open up again and he was able to focus on his positive qualities as opposed to the negative ones, and was able to feel better. He seemed to forget that he heard he wasn&rsquo;t an artist because now he could see he was one!<br /><br />What was most rewarding was when he showed his work to his mom. The art really helped connect them in a positive way. I&rsquo;ve noticed whether the Windows time is with just one child, a group or a family, the art has a way of connecting a family of all ages and they are able to find a way to share their feelings and show support for each other. The moms can really see how the children are feeling and the children can&rsquo;t wait to have that time with the moms to show them what they&rsquo;ve created during their Windows time.<br /><br />The Windows time has made a big difference to our clients and there really is a workshop for everyone.

Many of you will be excited to hear that Alli Holsen, a Women&#39;s Windows leader at Good Shepherd, has graciously shared with us Spanish translations of some of our favorite workshops!<br />See below for links to all AWBW workshops in Spanish.<br /><br />We know many of you translate workshops for your Spanish-speaking clients as you are leading them. Allie shared with us how much it helped to translate the workshops beforehand...<br /><br />I really enjoyed translating the windows workshops because they enabled our clients to have a better understanding of the workshop in general.<br /><br />Once I began translating the workshops myself, to the best of my ability, I noticed a big difference in how the workshops were run. Before, when I translated the workshops, the clients did not seem as involved in their artwork because it was difficult for them to understand a &quot;freestyle&quot; interpretation of the workshop while trying to run it. This is to say that I would try to directly interpret the workshop from English to Spanish while running it. Now that I am able to translate the workshops beforehand, the clients seem to enjoy the relaxation exercise more, they seem to enjoy their artwork and are more open about sharing!

arm, caring circle of people. Being exposed to other artists allowed me to become reenergized, and gave me new ideas to bring into my program.<br /><br />I have been using the Windows curriculum one-on-one with a 12-year old boy in our program. He&rsquo;s a &quot;real&quot; artist himself, and when I introduce new projects to him, he just lights up. I&rsquo;ve seen him change so much. These ideas are seeds that can grow in children&rsquo;s lives.<br /><br />Now I love using the Windows framework. Sometimes I remember hearing Olivia saying at the training, &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t find something you want, I&rsquo;ll get it for you!&rsquo; It was great to feel that someone cared so much, and I try to pass that on to the kids. I have a new awareness of how I relate to them during the art projects.

Aileen Fitz is a new Windows leader at Brighter Tomorrows in New York who attended a training at the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence this July. After the training, Aileen hit the ground running leading 5 workshops in the first month! After the workshops, Aileen noticed that the women embraced the art and set a goal to hold an exhibit for Domestic Violence Awareness Month.<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;It is truly amazing how the women at the shelter have reacted to the Windows program. Brighter Tomorrows offers many workshops all week long to our clients covering all aspects of their lives in the shelter, as well as, their future lives. The women talk all week long about the Windows program and literally can&#39;t wait for the next class. All staff has noticed this change.&quot;<br /><br />As the women participated in the workshops Aileen noticed that the art was also helping the women connect.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&quot;I am very amazed at the unity that takes place among the women. At the shelter many differences arise between the clients. During the workshop, it is amazing how they share because of the common issues they have.&quot;<br /><br />Over several weeks Aileen and the women created art for the exhibit, and discussed the power of art as a tool for social change. In October, just 3 months after starting their program, Brighter Tomorrows held their first exhibit called &quot;Faces of Domestic Violence.&quot; This exhibit featured 3 popular 2008 Windows workshops including Revealing Our Beauty and Power, Helping Hands Mandala and Stained Glass Window.&nbsp; Aileen reported that the women enjoyed creating for the exhibit as it gave them a purpose.<br /><br />&quot;The women all appeared to get a sense of accomplishment and felt part of the community awareness movement to end domestic violence. It was very uplifting and allowed them to recognize that they too have an important purpose.&quot;<br /><br />Aileen&#39;s goal for the &quot;Faces of Domestic Violence&quot; was to create awareness and engage viewers in a dialogue about domestic violence. Furthermore, Aileen hopes that the exhibit will become a catalyst for change and development within her community.&nbsp; The exhibit has traveled to four locations and reached over 200 community members. Aileen feels that the viewers have been truly affected by the messages communicated through the artwork as some viewers got very emotional and even cried. After the exhibit, Aileen shared that the exhibit was a success in supporting her belief that &ldquo;the responsibility of art is to mirror the dilemmas of society to the general public in hopes of creating social change.&rdquo;

I am now in my third year of coordinating the AWBW program at Equinox DV Services in Albany, New York. &nbsp;<br /><br />This program is so nourishing and healing, not just for the women in my weekly group, but for me also.&nbsp; It is nestling into my heart and growing roots there.&nbsp; It is like my garden &ndash; sometimes can&rsquo;t wait for it to grow, sometimes looks like an overgrown jungle, sometimes dumbfounds me with it&rsquo;s beauty.<br /><br />Recently, during Painted Prayers workshop, I felt so peaceful.&nbsp; At the end a member shared that she also felt peaceful.&nbsp; Yet another member said she hadn&rsquo;t felt as calm in a long time.&nbsp; We shared how becoming engrossed in making art allows us to lay trouble and preoccupations aside for a while, to rebalance and recharge.<br /><br />For October DV month I organized a small gallery of framed photos of art done during AWBW workshops in our agency.&nbsp; Agency staff and others passing through love it.&nbsp; Members of the AWBW group love it and are immensely proud.&nbsp; I am very proud and touched of the beautiful art members have created.&nbsp; The gallery is the result of two solid years of effort in developing the AWBW program here at Equinox and stands as an example for women who are rebuilding their lives.&nbsp; If the gallery could speak I think it would say:&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up.&nbsp; Continue the effort.&nbsp; It takes time and patience and courage to create a new life free of abuse, but you will have a beautiful result at the end.&rdquo;

Tricia&#39;s was very afraid of art and felt she was &quot;not good at art&quot;, however, after the first workshop she really felt relaxed. Tricia shared that, &quot;at first I was like oh no I&#39;m not going to do good at this, I&#39;m not good at art... and now I&#39;m running to these classes.&quot; <br /><br />Each class Tricia comments on how much she is learning about herself. During the&quot;Self Love Maps&quot; workshop, Tricia included eyes at her midpoints as she feels that she is seeing more, more about how she got to where she is now and how she became the person she is today. She also enjoys coming because the classes make her feel good about herself and she is always so excited to take her work with her to display in her apartment as daily encouragement.<br /><br />Tricia has really opened up throughout the art process and has allowed herself to be vulnerable even when others are not so open. Tricia has been a source of motivation for other clients and she encourages them to join the classes.

AWBW is my favorite group. When I am coloring and making different designs it takes me to being a child and it feels good. I grew up in the fast lane. I don&rsquo;t ever remember being able to be a child. It brings up stuff, but not in a bad way. It frees my mind to go explore. I think about what I&rsquo;ve done and what I want to do. The light colors help me feel happy. And I&rsquo;m not alone. I see that everybody carries the same feelings, just different situations. I didn&rsquo;t realize others have the same deepness and me. It&rsquo;s intense for me but it&rsquo;s OK. I know that crying is a healing process. I really like when I get into it. I learned it doesn&rsquo;t matter that I&rsquo;m not an artist. It&rsquo;s not about that.

I had the experience of a lifetime when I went to Nicaragua and worked with the beautiful women there.<br /><br />Through Wisconsin/ Nicaragua Partners of the Americas I was asked to facilitate an art workshop for 30 disadvantaged women who are training to become better leaders in their communities where there is a high incidence of domestic abuse, compounded by low employment and high alcoholism. Although I have worked for almost 15 years in the Wausau community advocating for victims of abuse, I didn&#39;t realize the extent of global violence against women and young girls until I returned from Nicaragua.<br /><br />It was heartbreaking for me to see the poverty these women lived in. And it was humbling to see how strong and beautiful and brave they were. In Marathon County, we have so many wonderful services I can offer for victims, but in Nicaragua, they barely exist. If a woman is in danger, there is no shelter for her to go to. The police are not likely to help because there are few established laws against domestic violence that are enforced. During Nicaragua&rsquo;s ten-year civil war, rape was used as a control tool.<br /><br />The workshop I lead was called &#39;Unmasking our Pain, Revealing our Power.&#39; It was so amazing, because I wasn&#39;t sure how to talk to them about domestic abuse and sexual assault, so I just casually talked as they were making their masks. I told them about what the women in the US told me about their experiences and asked them periodically if they were OK with what I was saying, did they want me to go on? They shook their heads, yes, so I continued. Some of them started crying and I just went over to them and put my hand on their shoulder. Later, some came to me to talk individually, but we had to have an interpreter with us to translate. I think they know they are not alone.<br /><br />The mask-making project I led graphically illustrated the effects of domestic abuse. In exchange, the Nicaraguan women helped me better understand their culture and how to effectively work within it.<br />The masks have since been displayed in Wisconsin and plan to return to Nicaragua for a possible exhibit at an embassy with many local leaders, women&#39;s organizations, and the 30 women who made the masks. What a great opportunity to shine a glaring light on the gender violence in Central America and all acts of violence against women around the world.&quot;

A client came in who had a difficult time expressing her emotions to anyone, including her kids.&nbsp; From the day of her very first AWBW art workshop, she found that art gave her a way to figure things out about herself and find strength.&nbsp; She always had something new and unique to share about how each workshop helped her.<br /><br />One day when her children were feeling upset because of her abuser&rsquo;s actions, she used the same set-up that we use in art group with her children. The children felt special and were able to communicate with her because of it. <br />Since this day, she continued to experiment with art at home. She wants to create an entire room full of art so that her children can go there to relax or have family time. <br /><br />She says that art has helped her find herself. She has found such peace that people around her, strangers and family members, tell her that she is different. Not only has she been able to open up with people, but her children have been able to open up so much more. <br />

While doing the project Self-Nurture Portraits one woman sat in front of her blank canvas and cried about how ugly she felt as a result of the abuse. She began to elaborate on her feelings and soon the tears stopped.&nbsp; She picked up her paint brush and began painting her image.&nbsp; As the piece progressed, she discovered her creativity and ability to express herself on the canvas. With each stroke she expressed amazement and enthusiastically solicited the group&#39;s support. At one point she said, &lsquo;look, I am beautiful!&rsquo;&nbsp; Words cannot express the power of this inspiring transformation.&nbsp; Thanks to AWBW for providing the vehicle for healing. On behalf of the women of the Lotus Project, we are truly grateful.

Most of our clients are monolingual or have limited English speaking skills.&nbsp; The art has really been the most personal and effective way of not only breaking the language barrier among the women, but also a way for the women to bond with one another on a deeper level.&nbsp; It&#39;s amazing how art has the power to transcend boundaries and help the clients relate to one another without words.

I think the best part of the Windows program is that it immediately shows women that they are capable of creating something beautiful.&nbsp; Many women start out saying they can&#39;t do art, therefore the workshops prove that their other &lsquo;cant&rsquo;s&rsquo; are also possible.

In our individual session, one of my clients who is still living with her batterer, recently disclosed to me that he took the abuse to a higher level and recently choked her, she was scared, but still hadn&#39;t fully grasped the severity of the situation. I showed her the Asian Pacific Islander art book, and there was a beautiful painting with the silhouette of a woman, and a quote that stated &quot;I realized if I stayed in this life, it was death.&quot; My client read that aloud and tears started streaming down her face as she said aloud, &quot;If I don&#39;t leave it&#39;s death for me.&quot; This was the first time that she realized it, and she knew that she needed to leave him for good. She took the booklet with her, as she stated it gave her peace to know that other women had survived situations similar to hers.<br /><br />I am so excited by how powerful this was, I want to order many more to share with my clients and the community!

<strong><em>Yolanda is a Leader at South Gate Police Department&#39;s Family Violence Prevention and Education Program.</em></strong><br /><br />This was my first month leading the workshops. I was so excited when I returned from the training that I immediately shared my experience with my supervisor and the detective that handles domestic violence cases. My supervisor is loving it. He wants to get involved and actually offered to assist me with the workshops. He even asked about attending the training himself in the future (in our department, this is huge).<br /><br />As the officers pass my office they ask about the art. At first they joke about it, but after I share with them about the workshops and the program they are really genuinely interested. It&rsquo;s amazing to see how interested everyone is becoming in this. It is a very masculine environment here, and I was surprised at how interested so many of them are in the art! My supervisor is so excited about the program now, he has realized how important it is and he has noticed the impact it has already made!<br /><br />One woman, who has been in an abusive relationship for 21 years and who we have been worried about, had a breakthrough in one of the workshops recently! She has only been in these groups for 3 months and has done the art groups for even less time, but this last workshop was so powerful for her. We did the workshop &ldquo;Funeral of I Cant&rsquo;s&rdquo; and I saw something shift for her. After burying the &ldquo;I Cant&rsquo;s&rdquo; and thinking about her &ldquo;I Cans,&rdquo; I spoke with her about all of her &ldquo;I Cans.&rdquo; This allowed her to finally open up and accept help. She called me the week after and said &ldquo;I want a restraining order!&rdquo; She had finally decided &ldquo;I need to do this.&rdquo; She was finally ready to leave the abusive relationship.<br /><br />She kept telling me that I did this for her and I told her &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t me, it is you that did it. It is this program that did it!&rdquo;

One of my clients recently shared, &ldquo;This is one of the best things I have ever done for myself... The first day here you had me draw a tree. To tell you the truth I didn&rsquo;t even understand why a tree! But after we went on and with all the classes I got it, with all the art you had us do it turns out I really understand about all the hurt I&rsquo;ve been through.&rdquo;<br /><br />When this woman arrived she had been in an abusive relationship for years but she had never realized how bad things had really been. When she began the Windows groups it was quite a revelation for her and she grew a lot. When the women do the art it goes deeper, the process is much more internal, and there are great realizations.<br /><br />The tree became a powerful metaphor for her. She saw the tree and trunk as her entire being. She realized that she was a tree, either healthy or not. That she wanted a firm trunk to protect her kids, that she needed strong roots to be her feet.<br /><br />When we do support groups the focus is mostly on &ldquo;someone that did you wrong,&rdquo; the focus and blame is on &ldquo;him.&rdquo; With the art, they have to focus on themselves. It is asking &ldquo;how deep is that hurt, where did it come from?&rdquo; These women come in as victims and then have to work on becoming survivors. AWBW helps them with those tools that they have and need to survive.

So here goes my little story&hellip;. You see I grew up in domestic violence and I&rsquo;ve been working in the field for about 2 years but I never really spoke about it to anyone and most importantly it was never addressed by my father or my mother. Additionally, me and my father did not speak for years since my parents divorced and we have been trying to establish our relationship for the last 5 years. So anyhow, after the first Window Between Worlds workshop, I acknowledged that there were many unhealed wounds still within me that I needed to deal with or I needed closure for. I went home that evening and sat down and shared my experience and my art from the training with my stepmother, who I adore. Somehow I opened up and told her how I felt and how I wished my dad would stop walking around avoiding talking to me about what happened when I was younger. As you know the next day we did the funeral of &ldquo;I cant&rsquo;s&rdquo; and one of my most difficult &ldquo;I cant&rsquo;s&rdquo;&nbsp; was &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk to my father about the past&rdquo;. So the next day when I returned from the training I noticed my dad seemed a little nervous and out of the blue he just started talking about something that we&rsquo;ve been avoiding speaking of for 25 years. He started telling me how he experienced many of the things I experienced growing up, which I never knew, and eventually he brought up the subject about the things that happened between him and my mother and he apologized for everything and we ended up hugging and crying for hours, which is something we have never done (hug and cry together). Furthermore, I felt like I got to know my father all over again! I am so grateful to you girls for the training, for your kindness and your mission! I sincerely thank you all and I hope God continues blessing A Window Between Worlds and all of you individually! Thank You!

At a fundraiser for our agency, we held a silent auction at our yearly wine tasting event including, Power Masks (2/1/2001) created in our women&#39;s art-workshops. The Power Masks were created with half of the face as the face of the victim and the other half as the survivor. At first I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of selling their art, but the reaction at the event was amazing and really connected the donors to the survivors!<br /><br />As people came up to see the masks I was able to share with them some of the clients&#39; background, which made them feel really connected to the clients and their art. They were interested in what goes through the victims&rsquo; minds and how it affects them. It was so powerful that people kept coming back to the tables to see the masks.<br /><br />Everything was &ldquo;Wow! A victim did this?! I wonder what they were feeling, it&rsquo;s very powerful.&rdquo; It left many people almost speechless it was that powerful. People were asking &ldquo;What happened with this victim? Why is there a broken nose? What happened to them?&rdquo; I had also typed up stories for each mask to go with them which everyone appreciated. It felt really good to see people&rsquo;s reactions and to see how they could connect and understand.<br /><br />We hold this event every year but it has never been like this. In the past the donors never got to really feel what was going on with our clients and our agency. They never had such a strong connection and understanding before. Having their art and sharing their stories made a huge difference.<br /><br />In the end everything was sold! The experience not only connected our donors in a powerful way, but it also strengthened the women&#39;s self-esteem knowing that their art was sold and appreciated. It left them wanting to do it again, and left us definitely wanting to include their art in more of our events!<br /><br />

We are thrilled to share with you Women&rsquo;s Windows leader Elka Kazmierczak&rsquo;s beautiful and inspiring publication Art of Survival: Women, Healing, and the Arts, for as Elka shared with us you are &ldquo;the very persons for whom the book was created!&rdquo;<br /><br />Art of Survival is an inspiring and powerful publication that &ldquo;focuses on art as a source of self-knowledge and transformation in the lives of all women but especially survivors of abuse.&rdquo;<br /><br />Elka shares with us in her own words that, &ldquo;This book is my dream that came true.&nbsp; This book expresses my desire to empower women and to help them see themselves in the constructive light of human creativity.&nbsp; In this book I was able to bring to fruition my personal experience as a survivor of abuse and my professional experience as an artist, designer, educator, researcher, and art leader.&nbsp; I wanted the wide range of media, especially quilting and fiber art to serve other leaders as inspiration for creating new art workshops.&nbsp; I think it is a gem full of beauty and moving intellectual and emotional content.&rdquo;<br /><br />Within the publication are two essays by counselors who work with survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault.&nbsp; One is by Women&rsquo;s Windows leader Truddi Clark who discusses the effectiveness of art-making in healing.&nbsp; She shares various breakthroughs that occurred in her art-workshops in the creation of Me Dolls and Feelings Collages.&nbsp; Truddi shares that &ldquo;making art is powerful.&nbsp; It is one of the most valuable tools battered women use to regain their self-esteem and find their peace within.&nbsp; I have seen women who could not utter a word about themselves but were able to unearth their feelings through drawing.&rdquo;<br /><br />You will be inspired to see art from other AWBW workshops as well!<br /><br />To find out more about Elka&rsquo;s book and to order it visit her website at www.art4e.org. We hope that it inspires you as much as it has inspired us!

Many clients that enter APWC have suffered severe emotional, physical and psychological trauma. The goal of implementing art empowerment workshops is to encourage healing by participating in calming art activities. During the workshops, participants are encouraged to focus on their own well-being through self-expression, self-renewal and, at times, self-discovery. APWC supports participants as they use art to navigate through suppressed feelings that they have never had the chance to come to terms with in a safe and healthy environment.<br /><br />The most recent art empowerment activity that took place was called <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2857&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=quilt&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0">We Are Quilt</a> and involved the use of &ldquo;I Am&rdquo; statements. Participants wrote sentences that addressed their own thoughts and feelings about the way they perceive themselves and the world around them. With that information, participants were each given a piece of cloth and instructed to illustrate some of the statements they created. The art activity concluded with a discussion about all the thoughts and feelings that came up during the exercise. Participants then connected the pieces of cloth to make a quilt. The quilt was a great way to combine all of the participants uniquely artistic patches.<br /><br />Many participants expressed positive feelings about being able to make something that appealed to them not only on an individual basis, but something that could also be combined with other creations to make one quilt. &ldquo;I love art &ndash; like painting and coloring things. With events like this I find myself and what is in my heart.&rdquo; Others also had a chance to derive inspiration. &ldquo;When I see other people&rsquo;s art and how they put their own style into it, I am challenged to see what I can make for myself as well.&quot;<br /><br />As a leader in various art activities, it is uplifting for me to observe the positive changes that the workshop participants undergo. Many are often amazed by their artistic ability, which they never had a chance to explore and as a result of being in an abusive relationship. Participants can begin to correctly identify feelings of pride and happiness when they see their wonderful artistic creation. Others feel a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment at being able to achieve something that they have sole responsibility and ownership over.

<p>A Bangladeshi family comes to our office on Saturdays for therapy sessions with our Bangla speaking counselor. I was not working the first time the family came into the office but I heard from colleagues that the older child was six-years old and had enjoyed our children&rsquo;s area at the office. <br /></p><p> I was working the second time the family came into the office. I do not speak Bangla and the girl was very shy and did not speak much English. I tried to connect with her but it was very obvious by her body language that she was scared of me. I used several tactics to try and engage her, all to no avail. <br /></p><p>Remembering that she liked our children&rsquo;s area, I escorted her over to that part of our office and took out some art supplies for her to work with. At first she nervously looked around the room to see if anyone was watching her, as if she was doing something bad. I felt I was being a bit overbearing and she needed some time to get comfortable, so I sat at a desk nearby and started doing some paperwork. <br /></p><p>A few minutes later the little girl came to me and showed me a glitter pen that was not working properly. I was able to get the glitter pen working and the little girl smiled as she worked on her art creation. We found glitter pens in different colors and started communicating as best we could.</p><p> She shared about the abuse she had observed in her home at the hands of her father and his family, and also how someone at school bullied her. <br /></p><p>Through the art the little girl was able to connect with me. The next day I saw her at a community event, the little girl who wouldn&rsquo;t speak to me the day before, got so excited when she saw me that she ran up to me.&nbsp; Since then she has been back to our office a couple of times and we have worked on different art projects together. <br /></p><p>Engaging with art has really helped her open up, communicate with others, and be more confident.</p>

At first I wasn&#39;t sure about exhibits. It was actually the the women in the workshops that helped me realize how important an exhibit could be. The women seemed eager to be part of the message that the art can give to the community. &nbsp;<br /><br />In Scranton we have the First Friday Art Walk, where all the galleries are open. When I approached one of the participating galleries, the Director told me she had to present my idea it to the rest of the artists exhibiting in the gallery.&nbsp; The answer was a unanimous YES! When I told the women, they were very excited. We exhibited Speak Out Masks and each woman helped to write something about her stay in our shelter to go with her mask.<br /><br />The Speak Out Masks exhibit was held in May and was supposed to be for two days at the gallery. I utilized free publicity in the &quot;Weekender&quot; and put flyers up everywhere I could think of. I also emailed the local newspaper and everyone I knew on MySpace and Facebook. The response was so great that the gallery decided to host the exhibit for the entire month!<br />&nbsp;<br />I feel that hosting an exhibit is about the collective message that the individual pieces can provide to the community.&nbsp; Although the anonymity of the women is protected in the exhibit, they are very personal pieces that speak to individual viewers.&nbsp; At the exhibit I put out a response book for viewers.&nbsp; The comments were so encouraging that I can&#39;t wait to host another exhibit. One viewer wrote: &quot;I have been moved by the struggles I see here and hope that you will bring this exhibit to other places&quot;.&nbsp; Holding an exhibit of the survivors work can provide them with the sense of self worth that they have not felt in a long time.<br /><br />My advice to other leaders is to just try it once! When you see the response, I bet that you will look for the next place to exhibit.&quot;

First, the thought of holding your own art exhibit may seem crazy with all we do each day at our agencies. AWBW has brought a refreshing breath of air to our shelter. The clients and staff love it. The workshops not only provide inner relaxation, self esteem building and creativity, but also bring about a sense of purpose for the&nbsp; participating. Creating an exhibit only enhances these emotions for the women and children who reside in the shelter. <br /><br />My advice would be to start small and exhibit the clients artwork at the shelter. You would be surprised how proud the clients become once their artwork is hanging for all to see. Then, it must become a goal to create an exhibit for public display. It takes some time, but once you have the art framed and the tools to display it, you are ready to go.&nbsp; Start with schools, county offices, libraries etcetera. Our art exhibit has become part of our community outreach and awareness. We are dedicated to making our community aware of the issue of family violence. The exhibit is amazing in that it is total visual communication. Without using any words the art expresses true stories about&nbsp; this devastating problem, domestic violence. We have gotten very emotional and positive responses to our exhibit and I feel this form of awareness is excellent in addressing the issue of family violence.

Dear Wonderful Leaders,<br /> Roxanne asked me to say a few encouraging words about exhibits. In brief - they are one great way to get the word out about domestic violence and how each person can have a part in stopping violence against women.<br /> &nbsp;<br /><em>&nbsp;</em>So far we have had three exhibits in the past year - all three exhibits used the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2676&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=walk&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0">Take a Walk in My Shoes</a> project and two of the exhibits included a<em> Prison Art Project</em> done by the local womens&#39; prison.&nbsp; We got great feedback from the patrons who viewed the exhibits as well as the community college campus paper.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> It&#39;s not as hard as it might seem to host a really fun and interesting exhibit. The biggest thing is to find some great folks on staff or in the community who are willing and able to lend a hand to move the art work, make phone calls to promote the exhibit, and for set up and break down. I bet you have volunteers already who sort clothes, toys and toiletries and run your food pantry. You can call those folks and ask them to help you handle an exhibit.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> A venue doesn&#39;t have to be too hard. We found ours in the community college art department - they were thrilled to put our exhibit in the campus art gallery for a week. They even handled a good bit of the set up.<br /> <br /> This year we are asking the mid-city African American Cultural Center - Ashe Center to host the exhibit for us. Again they are handling the set-up and are even helping us mare arrangements for light snacks and beverages.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Don&#39;t be afraid to step out into the community to let them know about your work<br /> and how THEY can be a part of helping to stop violence against women. Folks are more receptive than you might think. Many want to help and just don&#39;t know how. And this is a great way to help!!

A Window Between Worlds has allowed my community to acknowledge the incidence of abuse. As art leaders we share a gift with the women that allows the family to heal wounds as their story unravels in their creations. <br /> <br /> The women stood proud and beaming with smiles from one ear to the other, as the community viewed their artwork.&nbsp; We couldn&#39;t have asked for a more perfect evening as the women spoke.&nbsp; I watched a reluctant community come together. It was a moment I will never forget. As tears rolled down the survivors face, I knew it was worth every second spent on preparing for this exhibit.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I urge all Leaders to hold an exhibit. Once you show the community all the artwork displayed, it will make you feel that you have touched&nbsp; not just the women but families, children, elders, police officers and lawyers. The more visible you are in the community, the more your program will grow.

A mother of four boys, Maria, was referred to Chicana Service Action Center (CSAC) for Domestic Violence Supportive Services in the Spring of 2009. At the time of her referral, she was fleeing from her partner, the father of her children. After working with an advocate at the shelter for several weeks, Maria disclosed a significant history of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her partner. Maria was an active in our A Window Between Worlds program. Four months after the initial referral, Maria said, &lsquo;the class changed my life.&rsquo; The art workshops have helped Maria build self-worth and confidence. Now she stated, &lsquo;I can look forward to a brighter future.&rsquo; She was surprised to see the potential in herself through working with art supplies to create beautiful art pieces. Maria is one of the women that has truly grown and flourished in the art program.<br />

While completing last years annual evaluation, I noticed that one of my clients, Pat, has been doing AWBW workshops since our program started at Equinox and that she had done 85 workshops. Pat has experienced a lot of DV and also struggles with addiction and mental health issues. Since AWBW started at Equinox it has become a favorite part of her week. Pat says it is the one time in the week that she feels good for a while.<br /><br />She becomes absorbed in the workshop activity and forgets her troubles.<br /><br />&nbsp;In this week&#39;s workshop members were introduced to some trauma education regarding the value of eliciting positive memories to balance the devastating impact trauma can have on ones nervous system.<br /><br />When Pat was encouraged to do art activities at home, but she explained that she couldn&#39;t do art at home.<br />She said: &quot;here, at Equinox, I come for the group and there is nothing else I have to do. At home I always think of 100 other things to do, and usually end up doing nothing.&quot;<br /><br />This provided me an important clue for helping Pat introduce creative activities into her daily schedule as an important part of self-care and for supporting her mental health.

As a leader, I have had the pleasure of working with&nbsp; wonderfully diverse women here at Refuge House. The Windows art program can transcend language barriers. As a native Spanish Speaker, with English as a second language, I can appreciate the difficulty that not knowing English can pose for people, particularly survivors of domestic and/or sexual violence.<br /><br />Nataliia came to us from Ukraine and is steadily acquiring English speaking skills. The fact that I cannot always convey ideas to her verbally, however, has never stopped her from taking risks and expressing herself artistically.&nbsp; When in doubt about instructions, you can expect Nataliia to quietly observe as she gathers more clues.<br /><br />During the Ornaments of Change workshop, Nataliia told me, &quot;art stops time for me. Which is important because I never feel like I have any time for myself.&quot;&nbsp; She also shared a lot about the customs in her country. Typically, the holidays are celebrated in early January instead of late December, for example. When I told her I would be submitting a picture of her ornament for a highlight story she was surprised and reacted very modestly. The only thing she asked for was an electronic copy of the pictures so that she could send them to her family back in Ukraine.

I started running the Windows workshops two years ago.&nbsp; At that time I had a case involving a mother with three children that were held hostage and sexually abused by the mother&rsquo;s boyfriend. <br /><br />I was scared to start Windows with the family so I began by conducting bracelet making workshops with the mom and her daughter, and slowly introduced journaling workshops with the daughter who was the original victim in this case. &nbsp;<br /><br />Two years later the trial finally began.&nbsp; Participating in the trial of a man, who sexually assaulted her, in front of her mother, was an extremely difficult task for my client&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; The little girl later said that she was only able to get through all four months of the trial because of the journal she kept throughout the criminal proceedings. <br /><br />The perpetrator ended up being found guilty and was sentenced to 144 years in prison.&nbsp; This case illustrates the positive and enduring impact that journaling workshops have the clients.<br /><br />Keeping in mind the power of journaling, my co-worker and fellow AWBW leader Joann Paz and I decided to start a teen girls group entitled: Be Strong! Girls Empowerment Project, where each group session would end with the participants writing in a journal. To get this project started my employer, through its South Gate Police Activities League, partnered with a local high school and created the group with one goal in mind, to give girls the opportunity to learn from professional women. Thus, encouraging them to follow their dreams and be strong, independent girls.<br /><br />While we are very excited to incorporate many Windows workshops into the group sessions, we are especially enthusiastic about the journaling. <br /><br />We have seen the impact journaling has had on the participants who have decided to continue with their journals long after they have left our program.&nbsp; This gives them a safe place to express themselves without fear or judgment.<br /><br />

<![CDATA[
When I first started seeing a family of three siblings (ages 8, 10 and 12), the only time the children spoke to each other was to point out each others&rsquo; negative actions. Living in a violent household taught the children to enact the abusive behavior that had been modeled at home.<br /><br />During our sessions I worked with the children on dealing with anger, communication, encouragement and feelings. We did the Cheering Frog Flags workshop that had the children make a banner with flags with encouraging messages. The children made four flags for their own banner and one for each of their siblings. When one of the siblings could not think of anything to put on her flag, her brother looked up and said, &ldquo;you could write down how nice you are and that you are a great sister.&rdquo;<br /><br />Throughout the workshop the children continued to make positive comments to each other about how nice and smart they are. Through the art workshops the children learned important communication skills and their mother informed me that after the Cheering Frog Flags workshop the children started to support, rather than belittle each other at home.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />Another group of siblings who were positively effected by the Cheering Frog Flags workshop was a 7 year old boy and his 10 year old sister who were still living in a situation where abuse was present.<br /><br />From the beginning, the siblings had a hard time communicating, much less supporting each other.&nbsp; In an effort to facilitate bonding between the siblings, I had them create Cheering Frog Flags. The siblings decided to create flags to serve as a reminder about how much they root for each other. The children also drew pictures on the flags that represented private moments between the two of them. The pictures they drew were aspects of a survival code that only had meaning for them.<br /><br />Throughout the session, the children smiled at one another, made their own personal flags, and proudly traded the flags they had made for each other. The looks on the children&rsquo;s faces as they accepted flags from their sibling said more than words could ever say. The last time I met with the children they did not try to make each other feel bad or speak about all the negative things they had done. Rather, the children supported and &lsquo;cheered&rsquo; each other on.

Participants look forward to having an AWBW workshop every week. They shared their feelings of freedom to express themselves and had fun doing the art. One day, we did the workshop <em><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2567&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=yesterday&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0">Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow</a></em>. One of the participants shared that she never thought about her past, present, and future in a positive way. Her past was too painful, her present was miserable, and her future was hopeless. However, the workshop helped her to reframe her thoughts and see the growth and changes that she had made. Moreover, she now wanted to move forward step by step towards a better future.

A week after she entered our shelter, we discovered that Lin was a diagnosed Schizophrenic who had not been taking her medication. Lin&rsquo;s batterer was extremely physically abusive and after her and daughter entered the shelter, her two year-old daughter began mimicking his behavior- hitting, biting, and yelling at her.&nbsp; Having grown up in China, Lin was very reluctant to come to a shelter that wasn&rsquo;t Asian based, but due to safety issues, she had no other options. The other five adult females at the shelter all spoke Spanish and more easily connected with one another. Knowing only limited English, Lin&rsquo;s language and cultural barriers coupled with her lack of basic social skills, ostracized her from the other shelter clients. <br /><br />The very first AWBW group that the clients attended together made all the difference.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to all of us, including Lin herself, she possessed great artistic ability and created two beautifully detailed Self-nurture Portraits.&nbsp; The other clients were very impressed with Lin&rsquo;s art and showered her with praise and appreciation for her creation, which helped to forge a connection.&nbsp; Moreover, when sharing about her art, Lin was finally able to open up about her thoughts, feelings and abusive past, to which the other group members instantly related.&nbsp; After that group, the clients began working together, and focused on their similarities, rather than their differences. Surpassing uncommon language, culture and behavior, art became the universal language through which the women could communicate and come together.

I did an AWBW workshop with my Teen Dating Violence (TDV) group, which is comprised of teenage mothers who are survivors of domestic violence. <br /><br />The girls have endured everything from physical, to emotional abuse.&nbsp; The group took place right after I attended the Inner-Self Portrait advanced leaders training workshop and the teens loved the project! One of the group members Tanya said she was, &lsquo;very happy&rsquo; to participate in the workshop and that her Inner-Self Portrait helped her reflect on everything she has been trough and was grateful to be where she is now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Several teens who were new to the group opened up about how they blamed themselves for the abuse they endured. By making their Inner-Self Portrait the teens were able to identify feelings and recognize they didn&rsquo;t deserve the blame they placed on themselves. <br /><br />The art was a great way to get the teens out of their head and challenge their self-blame.&nbsp; I left the group feeling inspired! The TDV group has grown significantly; together the teens embrace each other and begin to recognize the power they have as survivors. The teens have learned to take charge of their destiny and now have the tools to teach their children to stop the cycle of violence. <br /><br />Windows has been a great catalyst for helping the teens break the cycle and express their authentic self.

I incorporated art into the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) services I provided for a five-year-old girl who was repeatedly sexually abused by an uncle.<br /><br />When she first came to my office I was awestruck as she looked with great wonder and appreciation at the toys in my office.&nbsp; Slowly she began to trust me.&nbsp; I asked her to listen carefully to what her heart was saying, then draw her feelings with crayons.&nbsp; She quietly listened to her heart with eyes closed for a few minutes.&nbsp; She then proceeded to use her crayons to fill in a very large face with tears and a sad mouth.<br /><br />After each drawing she listened to hear her heart again and drew another feeling face.&nbsp; The progress was exceptional.&nbsp; I have watched her progress from first drawing a face that was crying and filled with tears to drawing a smiling face without tears. <br /><br />Upon completion of the final smiling face she stopped for a moment, listened to her heart and said, &quot;now I feel better, and I don&rsquo;t have to cry when I think about him anymore.&nbsp; I can go play, and keep playing without stopping and crying.&quot;<br /><br />It has been very powerful to watch her healing with the addition of art to EMDR therapy.&nbsp; I remain humbled to be a part of helping children heal and ever so grateful for the additional training and supplies from AWBW.

<![CDATA[
One girl came to our facility a year ago, when she was 18-years-old. She was physically and sexually abused as a child. She left her family at a young age, and was living on her own in a big city. She began prostituting herself and became a victim of teen dating violence (by her &lsquo;pimp&rsquo; who she was also in relationship with). She was hardened by the lifestyle she lived, and has been in the youth detention system for 1&frac12; years.<br /><br />When she was transferred to our facility, she was still struggling with issues of past substance abuse and sex addiction. She had a lot of anger and a &lsquo;tough girl&rsquo; persona. She built up walls to protect herself and didn&rsquo;t participate a lot. At times, she threatened others and wanted to fight them.<br /><br />She began attending the Art workshops, which take place every week. They provide a creative outlet for her where she can bond with the other girls, let down her defenses, and do something fun. Like the other girls, she loves doing art.<br /><br />To tie in with Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we did Take a Walk in My Shoes . I asked each of the girls to pick a pair of shoes that really spoke to them. She picked black and red ones with really high heels and open toes. She immediately put them on and walked around the room showing them off to the other girls. They were like the shoes she wore on the &lsquo;outs&rsquo; (before she was in the system).<br /><br />She didn&rsquo;t decorate them much, but shared, &ldquo;I used to wear these to please others and now I wear them to please myself.&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t need to wear them anymore to get sexual pleasure and do what others want her to do. She can now step out, make her own decisions and do what makes her feel good.<br /><br />The workshops have been very beneficial for her. They&rsquo;ve allowed her to creatively work through her issues and share about them. The art has allowed her to express herself on a deeper level than she can in our general group discussions.<br /><br />The teen has shown amazing growth since she has been here. She is more social and has learned to confront situations without being defensive. She has now become a leader in the group, and is supporting the other girls (ages 15-19), in understanding<br />their own value.<br /><br />In the Loving Relationship Charms workshop, one of the younger girls with low self-esteem shared that she wasn&rsquo;t deserving of having a healthy relationship. The teen stepped in to validate her, and let her know she does deserve to be loved. She has become a great peer mentor, and someone that the other girls will listen to.<br /><br />She will be leaving the facility in 3 months. She is looking forward to attending college, getting a full time job, and living her life for herself,<br />not others.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

However, we can look at things as they happen with an open, creative, &quot;outside the box&quot; mindset and work towards creative solutions. It can be challenging working in a field where there is crisis floating around regularly to combat being lassoed into &quot;crisis mode.&quot; I have found that when this &quot;crisis lasso&quot; is around me I am not as capable of coming up with creative solutions to challenges. Planning ahead for common challenges, practicing self care and brain storming with other leaders has been helpful for me in avoiding the &quot;crisis lasso.&quot;<br /><br /> Leaving the crisis outside of workshops is also very important in creating a safe, restful &lsquo;window of time&#39; for artists attending groups. I try to find ways to make every artist feel welcome and comfortable. Here&#39;s a few stories on how I&#39;ve tackled these challenges:<br /><br /> <strong>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Translation Tips:</strong> Ideally we would be able to have an interpreter available for folks whose first language is varied from the facilitator&#39;s. However, I understand the reality that not all programs have the finances or volunteers ready to meet this important need. One way I&#39;ve gotten around this is to have folks who do interpretation, record the workshop introduction, relaxation and instruction onto a cassette recorder ahead of time. This could be done using a computer and then burning it to a CD as well. This way artists can use head phones to listen along to instruction when interpreters aren&#39;t available to attend the workshops.<br /><br /> <strong>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something extra!:</strong> Another way to assist in building comfort in group is to offer tea, coffee, or water. We facilitate the AWBW art group in the kitchen of the shelter sometimes, which makes serving beverages a little easier. On occasion there have even been fresh baked cookies to go along with the beverage service. Healthier snacks have go over well too&shy;.<br /><br /> <strong>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Childcare issues:</strong> Children who leave their group in need of time with mom or are anxious to be separated from mom can sometimes be distracting and/or interrupt the workshops.&nbsp; This is all very understandable but it can make it challenging to create that &lsquo;window of time&#39; for women. However, we have found some ways around this if piggy back rides back to the children&#39;s group or other enticers don&#39;t work.<br /><br /> <strong>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children in the group:</strong> For younger children, a high chair next to mom with some age appropriate art supplies and a leader assisting to keep the child entertained may work. For an older child offering that if they return to their children&#39;s workshop that mom will join them in children&#39;s group for the last 10 minutes of group. Another option is offering art supplies for a family workshop for another day if the kiddo returns to their group. Or sometimes mom may decide to move to another table and have a group with her child(ren) to have a family art group. If a mom is being challenged by a child interrupting her art time, as leaders we can offer up options of solutions and support moms in their decisions.<br /><br /> There are most often solutions to challenges that arise in facilitating AWBW workshops. I find it very empowering in introducing workshops to share with women attending group the AWBW philosophy that <em>everyone is an artist</em>. We can empower ourselves as leaders with the philosophy that <em>everyone can face challenges in a creative way.</em><br /><br /> As Bridget stated, challenges happen. We&#39;re here to help. The FAQ section is often updated to reflect new challenges that have arisen as well as new ideas to previous challenges you have all faced. &nbsp;Please don&#39;t hesitate to call, email or check the FAQ&#39;s whenever you feel you&#39;re facing an insurmountable challenge.<br /><br />

During one of my very first support group sessions, we did the Center of My Universe project.

ppiness I felt upon finding a picture of a lady talking on the phone, laughing, with curlers in her hair. I put it in the center of my collage to represent myself. I remember how powerful it felt to trust my instincts and select the images I was drawn to. At the time I was so preoccupied trying to get through each day I was unable to see the infinite possibilities the future held.&nbsp; I viewed the process as &quot;cutting out dreams.&quot; Kept safely tucked away in my bedside table, I took out and examined my collage every once in a while, unaware of the effect it would have on my future.<br /><br />One year later I made my second Center of My Universe collage. Having been out of the abusive relationship for a significant amount of time, I now allowed myself to include a picture of a bride, a family of four walking down the beach, and the word love. On the back of my collage I instinctively wrote my name, my daughter&#39;s name and the name of the man I had just started dating five months ago. I was focused on my daughter and my scholastic endeavors so I did not take my new relationship with this younger man seriously. College graduation was another seemingly impossible dream that I included in both of my collages. Throughout my childhood my father was verbally abusive and would consistently tell me that I was dumb. He said that never in a million years would someone like me go to college. Still feeling petrified of school I reluctantly began taking classes and would look to the graduation themed pictures on my collages for inspiration. I did eventually graduate from college. Afterward I looked at my collage and thought, &quot;oh my God, my dream came true.&quot; At the time I was still unaware that other dreams I included in my project would also come to fruition.&nbsp; After I wed the partner I failed to take seriously at the beginning of the relationship, I had a huge light bulb moment. On my wedding day I thought about calling my AWBW leader because I realized that almost all of the seemingly impossible dreams I identified during the workshop came true. Simply put, AWBW allowed me to glimpse into my future, which in turn gave me feelings of hope and helped me heal.<br /><br />Through AWBW I learned that even if you don&#39;t believe something can happen, the simple act of identifying and acknowledging your dreams in your artwork can help to make them come true. Currently, I live happily with my husband and my daughter, and continue to reference my latest collages daily.

An eight-year-old girl who is residing at the shelter had such a severe temper tantrum one day, that we were forced to call the Psychiatric Emergency Team (PET).&nbsp; She exhibited a lot of disruptive behavior, refused to attend school, and was violent with the other children.<br /><br />Unable to articulate her feelings, the girl sat mute in the corner, refusing to talk or make eye contact.&nbsp; While waiting for the PET team to arrive I knew that I needed to find a way for her to access and communicate her inner turmoil.&nbsp; I decided to combine the Feeling Friends and Heart Stories workshops so she could speak freely from her heart, through her art. <br /><br />Using AWBW&rsquo;s Feeling Faces chart made it easy to create a small banner that contained the different feeling words which empowered the girl to identify and define a myriad of feelings and emotions. She created three hearts on her project, each heart contained a feeling word.&nbsp; The girl wrote safety in the largest heart which allowed me to recognize her need for safety and reinforced that she would not articulate or trust us enough to share her emotions until she felt safe. &nbsp;<br /><br />The art was so effective in calming her down that by the time the PET team arrived they didn&rsquo;t need to take her!&nbsp; Once I discovered what a wonderful communication tool the project was, I shared it with her mother and helped the girl hang it on the wall of her room.&nbsp; From that day on, every morning the girl would choose which feeling best represented how she felt that day and then placed the feeling word banner in her Feeling Friends hands.&nbsp; This ensured that the girl would not get embarrassed and hide her feelings, rather she communicated her feelings through her &quot;Feeling Friend&quot;. Now her mother has insight into how to meet her daughter&#39;s needs.<br /><br />Since that day I have seen a complete change in the girls personality.&nbsp; She is a lot more cooperative, she attends school, and even interacts with the other children! <br /><br />This experience was a turning point for me and exemplified the power of art to articulate feelings and emotions that otherwise would have been buried.

Tracy came to DOVES after enduring a lifetime of abuse.&nbsp; As a child, different family members physically, sexually and verbally abused her.&nbsp; As an adult, Tracy emulated the types of relationships she saw as child, leading to three different abusive relationships and her children being taken by protective services. <br /><br />When Tracy came into the shelter, she began the Windows group, although I tried to emphasize the workshops were for healing and for self-discovery, she really didn&rsquo;t see beyond simply creating arts and crafts. Tracy&rsquo;s therapist was also working with in individual counseling. Although we attempted many things, there was still something missing in her healing process. <br /><br />Tracy had previously completed eight art workshops within a two-month span and was present for the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2588&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=tunnel&amp;submit.x=12&amp;submit.y=9" target="_blank">Tunnel Books</a> project. Just before she finished this project she laid the three phases out on the table side-by-side in front of her and looked at them very intently.&nbsp; She started with a slight smile and then got a glorious look of awe on her face and said, &ldquo;I finally understand what is happening with these projects. I really see that my past has made me what I am now and what I&#39;m doing now really will change my future and it&#39;s great!&rdquo;<br /><br />The art allowed Tracy to have an awe-inspiring moment; like a light bulb went off above her head! Through collaging her past, present and future on her Tunnel Book, Tracy was able to see her abusive childhood for what it really was, how it shaped the choices she made as an adult which led to her shelter stay. Now she also saw how her time at the shelter was peaceful and it allowed her to see she had a future.&nbsp; <br /><br /><div align="left">Tracy&rsquo;s Tunnel Book helped her to see she had value, worth and a future. Because of the art, she was finally able to say, &ldquo;this is what I&rsquo;ve been looking for&hellip;I know where I&rsquo;m going, I know where my future is.&rdquo;</div>

<![CDATA[
When an eight-year-old boy arrived at the shelter, he had a lot of rage. He had witnessed a lot of domestic violence in his home, and was threatening to kill himself. Through working with him, I learned that the anger was directed towards his mom as a result of an incident. One day, in the family car, his dad started pulling his mom&#39;s hair and hitting her. He was with his brother and sister in the back seat. His mom tried to get away and said she was going to jump out of the car. The little boy felt she didn&#39;t care about him and was going to abandon him.<br /><br />At first, the boy only knew two feelings - rage and happy. Through the different art projects, like &quot;What Makes Me Shine &quot; and &quot;Putting Myself Back Together,&quot; he started to open up and identify more feelings, such as scared, sad, jealous, and excited. He started using colors and symbols to express what he felt. When he was mad, he used red to draw the devil inside. When he was happy, he used yellow to represent sunny.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />In his own version of the Feelings Faces chart, he made faces to relate to specific feelings and we took pictures of him with the different expressions. Under each face, he drew a word to go with each feeling. After this activity, he was able to talk about his feelings more and cope with his emotions in a positive way. This workshop opened up a window of communication with his mom. Before, they both kept their feelings inside and now they are more comfortable sharing their feelings. She was able to better understand what her son was feeling, and he was able to see that his mom had feelings too. He stopped saying he was going to kill himself, and was able to cope with his feelings in a more positive manner.

When we begin the Windows workshops and share them with the group, everyone is very enthusiastic. Recently, one of our participants asked us to explain more about the program. We printed out information about some of the workshops she attended, and she glowed with pride each time she could point to an art project she created. <p>The participant saw the workshop entitled <em><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2756&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=baggage&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Changing Our Baggage</a></em> , and said, &lsquo;Hey, my bag is outside on the wall in shelter. The ones we made last month. You know I liked making the bag, but I thought the thing about changing our baggage seemed dumb-and then we sat around and talked about the bad stuff we carry around-and I thought I&#39;ll put that inside the bag and leave it. I&#39;ll put my positive goals on the outside and that&#39;s the stuff I keep.&#39;</p><p>The group member hesitated for a few minutes and smiled, &lsquo;I don&#39;t know. Before all this, if you told me I&#39;d make this kind of stuff, I&#39;d tell you no way. But it works, it really makes you think about everything and then when I make something and you guys put it on the wall or we show it somewhere like the bank. I&#39;m shy but I feel proud.&#39;</p><p>I think she accurately summed up what your program gives to all our program participants, a way to shed the past and dream about heading toward the future. It&#39;s an opportunity to try something different and actually make a piece of art unique, alive, and real. I think the beauty is not so much in the ultimate result but in the effort. The beauty is in the risk these artists take exposing their vulnerability, embracing possibility, and discovering options. It&#39;s all on the bag above. AWBW opens up a world filled with freedom, courage, joy, faith, strength, trust, and love.</p><br />

An 8 year old boy came to the shelter and in the year and a half we worked together I was able to offer him many Windows workshops.<br /><br />He was exposed to domestic violence his entire life and his mom was abused for 10 years, even during her pregnancy.

s mom and dad&rsquo;s bizarre behavior at home. It was a kind teacher who supported his mother and offered her help, which ultimately led them to DVSAC.<br /><br />When the boy first came to the Windows workshops he was full of anxiety, fear and stress. While he talked constantly, he rarely said anything. He was not aware that he was interrupting all the time, and I would have to gently touch his knee and help him refocus.<br /><br />Later, I learned that the dad was mentally ill. The little boy wanted to see him, but was always told it wasn&rsquo;t possible until he got well. The boy didn&rsquo;t understand, and kept bringing it up. Through journaling, he started to write letters to his dad. It helped him to feel more connected, and express his feelings in his own private way.<br /><br />While doing the art project Turning Over a New Leaf , he had a creative breakthrough. On the &lsquo;past&rsquo; side of the leaf the boy painted black using heavy strokes of color. He scratched out one eye, which just had an upper and lower lid. He said there was only one eye because he&rsquo;s afraid to look, and didn&rsquo;t want to open the other eye. He referred to himself as &lsquo;this boy&rsquo; when he was talking about his art.<br /><br />As a result of the project, his feelings were out on the table, and they weren&rsquo;t a secret anymore. Over time, he started to become more comfortable in his own skin. There are no more outbursts and he is much calmer. He&rsquo;s eager to do art and God&rsquo;s Eye is his &ldquo;favorite workshop ever!&rdquo; He&rsquo;s in the present moment, and is happy. He is not afraid and has the courage to speak up and say &lsquo;this is not right.&rsquo; He now talks about himself in the first person, and is not trying to close his eyes and run away from his feelings.<br /><br />&nbsp;In most of the workshops he sits really close to me during the closing circle. When it was his turn to share, he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember you forever.&rdquo; It touched me a lot, knowing how grateful he was for me bringing him the art.<br /><br />

As a windows leader I continue to be amazed by the impact the windows program has on our participants, particularly those who do not reside in either of our housing programs (emergency shelter or transitional housing). Two participants that fall into this category continue to attend our Spanish Support Group at Refuge House, Inc. through our outreach program. As a result they continue to have access to the windows art program.<br /><br />Sandra Torres stated, &ldquo;No one will ever believe I made these dolls.&rdquo; When I asked her why she simply said, &ldquo;They are too cute.&rdquo; When I asked her how the art program and this workshop had helped her she stated, &ldquo;It helped me relax for a while, enjoy myself, and benefit from the company of other women who make me think more positively and feel more positively.&rdquo; Sandra, who is from El Salvador, also enjoyed how the different dolls seem to reflect all the participant&rsquo;s respective cultural differences.<br /><br />A second anonymous client stated (translated from Spanish), &ldquo;I have never considered myself particularly artistic. Then I started coming to this group and learning more about abuse and about myself. I find that outside of here there is a lot of noise. Too many things to worry about and too many self doubts in regard to my ability to make decisions that will keep my children and me safe. Here I can relax and find my inner strength.&rdquo;<br /><br />Neither of these ladies, be it due to modesty or simply not knowing, give themselves half enough credit. Having founded the Spanish support group the Spring of 2008 when I recognized the lack of support systems for non-English speaking, Hispanic immigrant, survivors of domestic and sexual violence, I recognize that it takes more than leaders to run a group. These women show their strengths every single day and every single group session. They keep coming. They keep taking risks by sharing and experimenting. And they keep supporting one another through their own healing journeys.

<p>&lsquo;Angela&rsquo; is a five year-old girl who entered our Outreach program after her mother left her abusive husband.&nbsp; Angela had constantly seen verbal arguments in the home, and had heard her father threaten her mother on multiple occasions.&nbsp; As her mother was preparing to leave the home, Angela&rsquo;s father punched her mother in the face, and then went to his car and got a gun, which he waved around in front of the family.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Since then, Angela has had difficulty coping with the trauma, and had begun to cut her arms in an attempt to alleviate her pain.&nbsp; She told her mother that she wished she was dead.&nbsp; <br /></p>Angela appeared to suffer from such debilitating anxiety, that she was afraid to have her mother leave the room during counseling sessions, and needed to have the door open at all times.&nbsp; Along with helping the family seek therapeutic services, I worked with Angela to help her build coping skills.&nbsp; The best way to help Angela turned out to be art! As she is too young and too deeply traumatized to be able to verbalize her fears, the became her vehicle of expression.<br /><br />During a recent session, I decided to use the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2885&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=crayon&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0">Aggressive Crayon</a> warm-up, as Angela had difficulty understanding what to do when she was angry, and tended to turn it into anxiety.&nbsp; At first she was reluctant to show anger, even on a piece of paper.&nbsp; As I showed her how I could &lsquo;be angry,&rsquo; she began to dig her crayons into the paper and scribble furiously.&nbsp; As we both pressed down on our papers as hard as we could, her face began to relax; we kept going until she was out of breath, and we were both laughing.&nbsp; Not only was this warm-up a clear way for Angela to understand &lsquo;anger,&rsquo; it was also a safe place for her to leave it, freeing her to experiencing a release.<br /><br />In the days and weeks after the warm-up Angela has shown improvement.&nbsp; She lets me shut the door now during sessions, and her hyper vigilance appears to have decreased.&nbsp; While still anxious, Angela is able to manage her fears better and engage with other children. She is now in therapy at a local mental health agency.<br /><br />As her mother has also been getting support at Emerge, and we have been talking to her about how to help her children get through this, her mom has reported that Angela has not cut herself in a while.&nbsp; Part of this, I believe, is due to Angela not seeing her mother crying as much at home, and Angela feeling like she is living in a safe place.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Obviously, the road for her will be a long one, but there has certainly been improvement, and the art has been extremely helpful to her.&nbsp; Angela has been coming less frequently in the last several weeks, but I see this as a good sign as previously she had been asking for me constantly, which worried me. I didn&rsquo;t want Angela to feel like I&rsquo;m the only safe adult in their life, but have an entire network instead.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The progress, however, is occurring, in even more profound ways than we are able to see, but her symptoms have clearly decreased, and I think that she will pull through!<br /><span class="EmailHeader"></span>

up in their new home to serve as a reminder to keep moving forward.&nbsp; <br /></p>The family jumped right into creating and each of them thoroughly enjoyed taking turns adding to the artwork.&nbsp; One child drew himself as a superhero because that is what he wants to be when he grows up.&nbsp; The other children also drew themselves and added a house, an apple tree, a swing set, and a pool which they had at their previous home and miss terribly.&nbsp; The mother drew herself wearing a cap and gown to represent her desire to graduate from high school. <br /><br />She never had the opportunity because she married her batterer at a young age and he didn&rsquo;t allow her to complete her schooling.&nbsp; She also added a home and a car as those are two important things she is working to acquire. Because they love making Shrinky Dinks, the family decided to have each member add a Shrinky Dink to the bottom of their Pass the Painting creation.<br /><br />When they completed the art they were all very proud and amazed at how well everything turned out. The mom in particular was elated about her Shrinky Dink because she had something to represent each of her children on it.<br />&nbsp;<br />The workshop was beneficial for the entire family because they were able to enjoy working together, bond, communicate and envision a future of their own design. It was obvious how special the families&rsquo; art was to them on their last day at the shelter.&nbsp; When they were dropped off at their new place all of the family members made sure that the bag with their art was not left behind or squashed. <br /><br />They&rsquo;ve gone through so much abuse and this piece of art will serve as a tangible reminder to keep setting and working towards reaching new goals.<br />

This client is being seen in individual therapy because of the sexual abuse that occurred towards her sister.&nbsp; I facilitated the &quot;<a href="http://awbw.org/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2625&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=bad+feeling&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Let Bad Feelings Fall Away</a>&quot; workshop with the client, her sister and her mother.&nbsp; Each family member was to write the things from the last year they are letting fall away.&nbsp; It was very hard for the daughters at first.&nbsp; But once mom began making many leaves, both daughters identified the feelings that they want to let go of.&nbsp; The session really blossomed from start to finish, aiding in the communication that had been &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; in the family system.

This workshop is very powerful.&nbsp; It gives participants a creative opportunity to ponder about their growth and transformation during their struggles out of Domestic Violence.&nbsp; One participant stated, &ldquo;Being so busy keeping up with changes as a survivor of DV, I never stopped to think of the strength I have gained, of my renewed passion for life, of my renewed self-esteem, and most importantly &ndash; that I got Louise back.&nbsp; I had stopped being myself during the abuse.&nbsp; Today, right now! Thanks to this workshop, I realize I am a new butterfly.&rdquo; <br />

I have to admit that of all the roles I play at my agency, Refuge House, Inc. in Tallahassee, Florida, my favorite is being a group leader. Working in a domestic and sexual violence agency means that I often see the worst of humanity reflected in the faces of the many women, children, and men that we serve. The only thing worse than the knowledge of that cruelty is having firsthand experience: being a survivor.<br />As a survivor of childhood incest and domestic violence, I remember the lows in my life. Yet somehow here I am, happy, in a healthy and loving relationship, working to ameliorate the same abuses that played such an integral part of my childhood and young adulthood. <p>So what made me so resilient? I spent a lot of time getting comfortable with the question &quot;why?&quot; There really is no simple answer. Scholars are still grappling with the variables that may (or may not) yield the difference between a well-adjusted, resilient person and a non-resilient one. In an effort not to turn this into a college APA-style paper, however, I will refrain digressing in that direction. What I will tell you is what made the difference for me.</p><p>My grandfather, with whom I lived until my father moved our family from Spain to the United States, made a difference. My siblings made a difference. A book I read in third grade, Good Touch, Bad Touch: An Educational Coloring and Activities Book by Positive Promotions, made a difference. Another book I read in fourth grade called Sarah, Plain and Tall by Patricia McLachlan, made a difference. My high school counselor made a difference. Telling my story over and over to anyone who would listen made a difference. My husband made a difference. The SMALL things made a difference.</p><p>So what is the point? Well, sometimes we overlook those small things that make such a BIG difference. Things like a smile, a snack for a woman who just arrived, a compliment, or a simple workshop. We can&#39;t know what someone&#39;s personal needs may be but when we treat him or her humanely, we add just one high moment to counteract the many lows that person may have experienced in his or her life. That is what I loved about the Personal Needs Flower workshop. It reminded me that help has no standard but compassion, and in the groups I lead, the participants demonstrate that compassion abounds.</p><br />

She always had a wall up, but during the art workshops she was awake and alive! You could see the change cover over her as she drew.<br /><br />For her monster, she drew a bird because she wanted to &quot;fly away free&quot; and leave the shelter. She explained that the bird had a beak to represent that she has a voice and wants to be heard, and it also had sharp claws for protection.<br /><br />When she shared about her project, I was amazed to even hear her speak! Before the art group, the most I ever heard her say was &quot;hi.&quot; As her family&rsquo;s exit date came closer, she was happy, more open during groups, and would even offer to help cleanup.<br />

Working with children in the capacity that AWBW has allowed me to do, is indeed a rewarding experience for all parties involved. These rewards, however, aren&#39;t met without having challenges along the way. &nbsp;This can be summed up in a workshop that I lead this month titled, Hands Are Not For Hitting.&nbsp; This simple, straight-to-the-point workshop addressed a very serious issue: the children were hitting their siblings all the time, and they literally could not keep their hands to themselves. <br /><br />When they heard the title of the workshop, Hands Are Not For Hitting, they put on their puzzled faces and tried to board the&nbsp;&ldquo;Denial Train.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments, they knew the jig was up and I had caught wind of their antics.&nbsp; So I began with the question, &ldquo;Can you give me one example of a good thing you do with your hands?&rdquo;&nbsp; For about ten seconds, I could hear the birds chirping outside of the window. The silence was broken when one child said, &ldquo;We do art.&rdquo;&nbsp; I acknowledged his example, agreed with him and asked again. Another sporadic example followed, &ldquo;We can wave?&rdquo; I continued my acknowledgment, agreement, and moved on. I gave a few examples of my own, and the children started to catch on.&nbsp; <br /><br />We then moved on to the examples of&nbsp;&ldquo;bad&rdquo;&nbsp;hand use. Immediately I got responses like, &ldquo;punching,&rdquo; &ldquo;pulling hair,&rdquo; &ldquo;pushing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;slapping.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was proud that they took responsibility, and admitted that they liked to hit and tease each other. I reminded them why they were here at the shelter and that violence had a major role in that, even though their actions weren&rsquo;t as extreme as what they had witnessed and experienced.&nbsp; I asked them if they wanted to set this example for the other children who were in the shelter, and how the other children must feel when they witness these actions. I told them if they take anything away from the shelter experience, I wanted them to fully understand the ramifications of their actions. <br /><br />The workshop concluded with an art element that helps the children remember what we talked about. They traced both hands, then labeled the inside palm of their left hand, &ldquo;5 Good Things&rdquo; and&nbsp;wrote one good thing on each finger. &nbsp;They did the same on&nbsp;the right hand, except they listed&nbsp;&ldquo;5 Bad Things.&rdquo;&nbsp;They personalized their drawings and titled their artwork,&nbsp;&ldquo;Hands Are Not For Hitting.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br /><br />After checking in with the children one week after the workshop, I asked them if they were following the guidelines that we talked about.&nbsp; I really wanted to hear it from the children, to praise them for their progress and give them encouragement for their continued success.&nbsp; <br /><br />Until their exit, the children had completely changed their ways. They no longer hit each other, and it seemed to be something they were happy with. I was confident that I made an impact on their lives and hoped that some of my influence would rub off on other people they encountered in the future.<br />

Recently, I sat down with three siblings who had just been brought to our emergency shelter; Lola was 16, Chris was 13, and Diana was 11 years old.<br /><br />They came from a household where their father abused substances, and would become violent toward their mother. They appeared anxious about being at the shelter and were initially very timid about expressing themselves with words.<br /><br />&nbsp;I used a storytelling icebreaker, which allowed us to build a communal story by each of us saying one word aloud. They really enjoyed this activity, and in order to continue opening the lines of communication, I figured I would do a journaling workshop to give them the opportunity to document their past experiences, as well as to allow them to become architects of a life free from violence.<br /><br />As a result, I was allowed an entrance into their personalities by seeing how they decorated the covers of their journals. The next week their mom told me, &lsquo;Oh my, you won&rsquo;t believe this, my son wrote in his journal about how much safer he feels here!&rsquo;&nbsp; His words illustrated how much he took the activity to heart and used his journal to express and release his feelings in a healthy way.<br /><br />This was a definitive moment for me as a Window&rsquo;s Leader; it reiterated what an integral facet A Window Between Worlds has been in my development as a Youth Advocate. I am once again reminded of the power of art, as a universal language that transcends all barriers, and becomes a foundation to healing all of our clients.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<span class="EmailHeader">Journey to Discovery<br /></span><p>A Windows Leader shares about the transformative experience she had during her Leadership Training. <br /></p>&quot;I, like most of the clients I work with, felt uncomfortable doing art.&nbsp; I perceived it as dumb, childish and pointless. Over that past two years, I&#39;ve been able to process a lot of my dark past and trauma using art.&nbsp; With art, I realized I did not have a childhood - which may have been the reason I felt uncomfortable feeling like a child.&nbsp; I was a busy, parentified child; I never got to be a kid. As a child, I experienced extreme physical abuse by my mother and sexual abuse inflicted by her husband.&nbsp; With no support, I resorted to drugs and alcohol to cope with the rejection and pain.&nbsp; I found myself pregnant at 14 years of age, with no place to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though I was placed in a wonderful foster home until the age of 18, my childhood, coupled with my experiences of violence and sexual abuse as an adult, left unresolved trauma and emotional pain. I did not have any healthy coping skills so I continued on a downward spiral of hardcore substance abuse and violence in all my relationships.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had some of my best breakthroughs creating art. I had a significant discovery during <em><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2655&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=journey+footprints&amp;submit.x=45&amp;submit.y=9" target="_blank">Journey Footprints</a>, </em>the very last art workshop of my Windows training. While creating a footprint to reflect my past, I was overcome with emotion when I made the connection between my past, where I am today and where I will go in the future.&nbsp; After taking time to process my creations, I not only felt better, but empowered!&quot;<br /><br />

Our crisis team immediately responded to the children and the staff who were affected. <br /><br />Due to the urgency and shocking impact of the situation, there was no time available to plan a specific workshop. However, we did bring art materials, and with the help of the high school who supplied butcher paper and card-making paper, we made a banner and cards for the family. One of the boys who helped with the banner was a former gang member with a history of school and personal problems. He took initiative with the project and stenciled Maria&rsquo;s name in bold, beautiful script. The students came throughout the day and wrote their condolences, memories and prayers on the banner; they created beautiful words of love and comfort to the family and to themselves.<p>While their voice could find no adequate way to express the grief, shock, anger and sadness, art found a way to communicate and to heal. All in one day, we witnessed the worst and the best that comprises the human spirit. <br /></p>The most beautiful part of the story was the outpouring of love from the students and staff, many of whom shared memories of their own traumatic losses which were triggered by the event. I am so grateful that we had our AWBW training. It truly gave us a wisdom and means to assist that which would not have been possible otherwise.<br />

<p>Janet is a 19-year old teen dating violence survivor. She is a teen mom and recently separated from her husband of two years. When living in the Phillipines she was also a victim of domestic violence. <br /></p><p>Her father was abusive to her mother and they had to run away from him many times. When she came to the U.S., fueled by her need to escape the domestic violence, she began dating the man who would become her husband. Bound by tradition, she married him in a whirlwind wedding. <br /></p><p> Soon after, he began controlling her and she felt that she had to obey and be a &lsquo;good wife&rsquo;. She no longer hung out with her friends and was slowly separating from her family. She was feeling isolated and scared which led to police reports and a social worker became involved. When the abuse became physical she left him but his promises of change brought her back to him. <br /></p>She was mandated to attend domestic violence groups and that is how she came to our TDV group. When she began in the group, she was quiet and would blame herself for the abuse. Since attending the group and using Windows, she has changed a lot. The workshop &lsquo;<em>I Can: Requiem for I Can&#39;t</em>&rsquo; really helped her solidify where she wanted to be. This workshop really impacted her because she felt like she could do better and she was going to be okay on her own. Her I can reads &lsquo;I can....do it on my own&rsquo;.&nbsp; She was empowered and renewed in her journey to live a violent free life. This enabled her to leave her abuser and she is now living with her mom. She continues to come to group.

One of my clients experienced every type of Domestic Violence. Her batterer was not at all concerned with where they were or whom they were with &ndash; if he got angry; he would beat her on the sidewalk, in a store, and in front of their family. She was told to be a &ldquo;good wife,&rdquo; and was raped repeatedly during her marriage. The children were subjected to physical abuse as well.<br /><br />When she first came to group she was very shy and too embarrassed to talk about her abusive past.&nbsp; In addition, she was in danger of having her children taken away from her and was&nbsp; fearful about sharing in the group.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I knew the Inner-Self Portrait would be good project for inner discernment. Although she was very quiet the day of the workshop and slow to begin working on her art, once she started, she seemed calmer and more at peace.<br /><br />The next week, she shared about the workshop, and said that day was one of the most difficult she had ever had. When I asked her what colors she saw while her eyes were closed during the relaxation exercise; she said, &ldquo;black.&rdquo; She also shared that she had been feeling depressed and had even considered suicide. It turned out that she had to force herself to get out of bed and attend the art group that day. She was terrified to tell anyone, especially me, how she was feeling. <br /><br />She revealed that during the meditation, all she could think of was that God was talking to her. She felt as though she had been brought to group to breathe and think about what she was contemplating. &ldquo;I felt like God sent you and this activity to me to save me,&rdquo; she shared. Upon leaving the group she realized she had so much to live for! <br /><br />The art allowed her to delve into her inner self and not feel embarrassed, ashamed, or insecure about her feelings. In addition, the project enabled her to collect her thoughts and for once, share about her past and present fears. Moreover, it gave her permission to talk about self-care and address her concern that I may call DCFS. <br /><br />The art workshop encouraged a beautiful transformation and gave her hope for the future. Since this activity, she has become more trusting and open to sharing her feelings and anxieties. The art has allowed her to finally evaluate her life, and has helped her to process her thoughts and feelings in a healthy way.<br />

&nbsp;Two women in my art group worked hand in hand for 8 hours to create a portrait of a woman to honor their new sense of identity and worth. Their own artistic process inspired this original project which they entitled &quot;I Celebrate Me.&quot;<br /><br />The women decided that they would honor themselves by creating a large portrait of a woman&#39;s face. Their creation epitomized their ever-changing and evolving selves.<br /><br />During the creation, they wrote a poem about self-identity in which they articulated embracing self-expression and self-love and developing boundaries. A line in the poem states, &quot;earlier I asked what it would feel like to embrace myself and be myself. It would feel like freedom.&quot; The imagery and power in the poem allowed them to bring a definition and context to the piece.<br /><br />Acting as a bystander, rather than a leader, I had the privilege of witnessing their artistic process and the opportunity to encourage the women to create their own art. I communicated how much I valued their ideas and input, and reiterated that my role was only to support what they&nbsp; wanted to do. At first, they kept asking for my validation, but eventually they gained confidence and felt strongly about their plans. The women admitted this felt uncomfortable at the time, but was also the most rewarding part of the process. This was their first big step in the healing journey that allowed them to take ownership.<br /><br />This project was featured in an exhibit. At the art opening and&nbsp; the &quot;I Celebrate Me&quot; piece was a huge success on many levels. Not only was this an empowering process for the two women, it allowed everyone to recognize the importance in valuing themselves. Plus, it helped to build a sense of community and it was an inspiration to all who witnessed the art!

To celebrate Christmas, our AWBW group decorated glass ornaments using the&nbsp; Ornaments of Change&nbsp; workshop. In this particular group, there were a large number of women who were about to finish their 45-day stay with us. The focus of this workshop perfectly fit the transitional time that the clients were facing. At the same time, it gave them something to take with them to remind them of their growth and goals.<br /><br />While living with her batterer, one of my clients referred to their apartment as &ldquo;the box.&rdquo; The nickname reflected the fact that my client&rsquo;s batterer isolated and rarely allowed her to leave their apartment. I had given the ladies the choice of decorating either square or round glass ornaments. She was very excited to see the square&nbsp; given the symbolism and powerful meaning that this shape had for her. She decorated all four sides of her&nbsp; ornament with the words, &quot;from now on&hellip; I will always&hellip; be thinking&hellip; outside the box.&rdquo; This creation shows how the art allows the women to be empowered by taking back control of their lives.<br /><br />During the closing circle the client shared that she will always keep this ornament on her Christmas tree. This would also serve as a reminder of her abusive past to prevent her from allowing another person to control her life.

This month we are happy to show an example of one exhibit that was held last October for Domestic Violence Awareness.<br /><br />AWBW leader Andrew Morales organized, <u>Vision of Hope</u>, an exhibition of artwork created by children at Human Options transitional shelter program.&nbsp; The exhibit took place at both the Coastline Art Gallery in Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa City Hall.&nbsp; <br /><br />The exhibition was very successful for many reasons: it increased awareness about domestic violence by sharing true stories of survival, plus it celebrated the children&#39;s creativity and honored their journey to healing.&nbsp; A twelve-year-old girl whose art was featured in the exhibit commented, &quot;I am so happy that my artwork will be up for the city to see!&quot;&nbsp; An eight-year-old said, &quot;It was really hard to get started, but once I did, I did not want to stop!&quot; <br /><br />&nbsp;The exhibit was viewed by nearly 200 people of all ages and ethnicities.&nbsp; One 50-year-old male viewer commented, &quot;the artwork is very meaningful and touching.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:DocumentProperties> <o:Template>Normal.dotm</o:Template> <o:Revision>0</o:Revision> <o:TotalTime>0</o:TotalTime> <o:Pages>1</o:Pages> <o:Words>34</o:Words> <o:Characters>194</o:Characters> <o:Company>A Window Between Worlds</o:Company> <o:Lines>1</o:Lines> <o:Paragraphs>1</o:Paragraphs> <o:CharactersWithSpaces>238</o:CharactersWithSpaces> <o:Version>12.0</o:Version> </o:DocumentProperties> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG/> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:TrackMoves>false</w:TrackMoves> <w:TrackFormatting/> <w:PunctuationKerning/> <w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing> <w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing> <w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery> <w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery> <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas/> <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent> <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <w:Compatibility> <w:BreakWrappedTables/> <w:DontGrowAutofit/> <w:DontAutofitConstrainedTables/> <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx/> </w:Compatibility> </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState="false" LatentStyleCount="276"> </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--> <!-- /* Font Definitions */ @font-face {font-family:Cambria; panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;} @font-face {font-family:"Lucida Grande"; mso-font-charset:0; mso-generic-font-family:auto; mso-font-pitch:variable; mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;} /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""; margin:0in; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-fareast-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";} @page Section1 {size:8.5in 11.0in; margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; mso-header-margin:.5in; mso-footer-margin:.5in; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} --> <!--[if gte mso 10]> <style> /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} </style> <![endif]--> <!--StartFragment--> <br />

<p>For a long time now I have wanted to integrate more fun into Windows time. The Self- Nurture Portrait workshop allowed all of us to be silly and let go of the type of self-awareness that often inhibits our creativity. I encouraged all of the women to have fun with the activity and not worry about being an &lsquo;artist.&#39; </p><p>The women&#39;s creations were all made in a lighthearted way, most of them not resembling themselves, but giving all of us a chance to laugh at ourselves. That release of laughter and enjoyment felt so good in a space that is often reserved for remembrance and vulnerability. </p>The workshop was a great bonding experience for the multicultural and multilingual residents in our shelter. Most of the women who live at our shelter represent a variety of ethnic backgrounds and speak numerous different languages. What they cannot communicate through speech, they are able to communicate through art. That can be a very powerful experience as women who share a common past, but don&#39;t always have the language or words to tell their stories, but find a way to share their healing processes through creativity and art.

irst came to our program, she was quiet and somewhat intimidated by the workshops. She seemed unsure of herself and her art. She consistently looked to the creations of others and would sit without making much progress on her own project. I started noticing that Casey would participate in the creation of other children&rsquo;s projects. She would encourage them and provide them with ideas much like she has had to do with her young siblings. <br /><br />I encouraged Casey to take these creative ideas and apply them to her own work. It was not long before Casey was creating and participating as much as and as enthusiastically as the other children. <br /><br />Today, Casey thoroughly enjoys the workshops and often asks to continue working on her own projects after the allotted time has ended. <br /><br />During our most recent workshop, &ldquo;A New Year Journal,&rdquo; Casey decided that she wanted to take her project home to work on. Later that week and before our next workshop, Casey brought her Journal to share with me. It was amazing how much thought and care she had put into her creation. She was so proud of her work and was excited to use her journal throughout the year to document her goals, wishes, and successes.<br /><br />Having time away from her siblings and the responsibility of caring for them gave her the ability to focus on her own wants and needs. She is thriving from the individual attention given to her during workshops and her self-esteem has blossomed with the ownership of her projects.<br /><br /><br />

PJ and K are two brothers who came to the shelter with their mother to escape domestic violence. <br /><br />During their time here, they participated in the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2751&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=feeling+friend&amp;submit.x=22&amp;submit.y=3" target="_blank"><em>Feeling Friends</em> </a>workshop together. Both boys had been working on ways to express their anger and other difficult feelings in healthy ways.<br /><br />This workshop helped facilitate a conversation between these brothers in a way that made it easier for them to express their emotions. PJ and K were able to talk about different feelings and identify times they experienced those emotions. When they realized they could use the &quot;Feeling Friends&quot; they created to help express their emotions with other people, their faces lit up. They eagerly asked to take their &quot;new friends&quot; to school with them, as well as to an after-school program.<br /><br />These brothers were so excited about this new tool, it sparked an additional conversation with their mother after group about what they had been feeling, and how they could work together as a family to communicate their feelings in healthy ways.<br />

When Monica first came into shelter, she was &quot;tough,&quot; kept to herself, and did not share much. While she knew she needed to be safe, she was not happy about having to be in a shelter with her teenage son. In her first DV 101 group, she had to leave because it became too much for her to hear about DV. She apologized and I let her know that it was okay and that there may be times in the future that she may have to leave again. I simply encouraged her to take care of herself. <br />Eventually, Monica became an avid attendee of the AWBW groups. For one of the Windows sessions, I facilitated the Me Dolls workshop. During the &ldquo;Me Dolls&rdquo; workshop we had some women who were very new to Shelter and they were a little &ldquo;shy&rdquo; about the group and doing art.&nbsp; Before I could get into my &ldquo;AWBW talk&rdquo; about the program, Monica was telling them it was OK to be shy, that each week we did something new and different, and that the group was another way of growing here at House of Ruth. After the dolls were finished, we went around in a circle she each woman shared her creation. Monica shared that her doll represented all that she wanted to be when she was still with her batterer. As a result of the support and empowerment she felt from her time in the shelter AWBW groups and counseling, she now wanted something different for her life and the lives of her children. She did not want to carry her old dreams with her into her new life. As a result, she decided to bury her doll in a private location only known to her and leave it behind so that it no longer would be in her new life.<br />Monica&#39;s experience with Windows allowed her to learn so much about herself in the group and have more confidence in who she is. She mentored the other women at the Shelter by telling them information about chores, schedules of group, and truly helped them feel more at ease. When she first came in, she had been so curt and short in her conversations. It became such a pleasure to see the change in her and hear her talk with other clients in a softer manner rather than be confrontational or defensive.<br />

approach coping with curiosity rather than judgment, use empowerment, avoid re-traumatization, and create collaboration and SAFETY)!<br /><br />To better prepare ourselves and facilitate through the trauma informed model, we research and gather to learn and run through the chosen AWBW workshop as group, brainstorm ideas and facilitation styles, and think about the self awareness, possible triggers, and wellness for the staff and participants. We understand that TIC is applicable to us as professionals as well as leaders so TIC is utilized even before our work with participants begins as we treat ourselves in the same way we treat our participants.<br /><br />Trauma Informed Care is based upon creating a safe space for our participants to express themselves using Windows Art. Having encountered dynamics such as simply the word &quot;art&quot; bringing about many triggers and trauma, in addition to feelings of competition, lack of confidence and/or self esteem or just plain disinterest for the participants, we notify our AWBW group participants in advance to give them the CHOICE of participating. We have come to learn and experience that calming the physiological self is important and purposeful for our participants who come from environments that are under continual stress. For those who choose to participate, we guide and invite them in breathing, relaxation, or meditation exercises with music fostering a calming tone and atmosphere. If these exercises do not suit the needs of a participant, we give them time to collect themselves and ask them to, first and foremost, be present to themselves to help normalize and validate their feelings.<br /><br />We aim to serve as guides, rather than experts and, more importantly, as compassionate witnesses. We understand that trauma is not healed in one workshop or group, nor is art healing for all participants. We relish opportunities to see awareness and healing unfold at the participant&#39;s pace and are neither hindered nor discouraged if participants are resistant, discouraged themselves, or choose to participate minimally. We encourage AWBW leaders to be flexible and modify each workshop to meet the individual needs of the participants. Many of our survivors are unfortunately accustomed to constant criticism, which is why praise is another key component in our practice. We make every attempt to observe and identify even the smallest of milestones.<br /><br />We enjoy all the workshops AWBW provides and we have some key workshops that seem to bring about much awareness of our Trauma Informed practice. <br />

For the past year, I have been facilitating support groups at SafeHouse Denver with the women in our shelter. I have noticed that during group, their collective interests are piqued when we cover certain materials they are interested in, and the discussion gets very lively with lots of laughter and enjoyment! I decided to take this simple yet poignant observation and run with it.<br /><br />About once a month, I ask the women to suggest topics that are relevant to them so I can incorporate and develop them into their weekly AWBW curriculum. The results have been enlightening. Once our residents were given the opportunity to choose their own topics and express them through art, they were infused with an entirely new level of empowerment!<br />As an artist myself, my personal philosophy is that there is no right or wrong when it comes to art. Whenever residents become self-conscious about their supposed lack of artistic ability, I tell them that even splotches of paint can be art (Thank you, Jackson Pollock!)! <br /><br />Thanks to AWBW&#39;s continued support, we are not only able to access a wide variety of creative ideas and relevant topics, but with your financial support we are also able to buy the supplies necessary to deliver those incredible groups. I couldn&#39;t do it without you!<br />

<![CDATA[
There was a survivor that came routinely to our Windows groups at the rape crisis centers and, probably for the first five times she joined us, she didn&#39;t create. She didn&#39;t utilize any of the materials and, in fact, since this survivor lived with a disability, she would sometimes need to stand in the corner because of her back issues that she had. We talked about the accommodations that she needed and the impact it had on people to have someone in the room who was not participating. She wondered if they thought, &quot;are they attending or are they watching us or what&#39;s happening?&quot; We wanted to equalize the experience for the group that were sitting at the table and who were doing the art process and we also wanted to make it a safe space for her. After five more workshops, she became someone who was fully involved and got so much out of the group! We had created a space that was safe enough for her. Sitting at a table during Windows time no longer was triggering for her despite her past experiences at a table when her father, who was both the perpetrator of the domestic violence and her sexual abuser would demoralize her. Once she started creating and sharing, the trigger of her being at the table began to come out in her sharing process. It was then that the other participants in the group would empower her saying, &quot;good for you to not sit down at the table then.&quot; &quot;That was you fighting back and being strong and you saying, &#39;He doesn&#39;t have power over me anymore&#39;.&quot; It was incredible to see folks who had first been triggered by her lack of participation and thought, &quot;Uh, why does she get to stand in the corner?&quot; were later able to see and appreciate that Windows time means that each person is choosing how they can feel safe in the room.<br />

One participant in the Windows group shared with me, &quot;When I did the thank you card to myself I was momentarily immersed in pleasant thoughts as I concentrated on expressing (visually) the things I love about myself and the people in my life. It was nice to have some busy peaceful moments free from obsessing and worrying about the sheriff&#39;s department, the court dates, the lawyer, the incessant pleas to &#39;just come back home...&#39; The card I made featuring a photo of one of my children sits on a bedside table as a constant reminder of all of the reasons I know I can care for my children in a safe, sane and peaceful environment.&quot;<br />

Over that past two years, I&#39;ve been able to process a lot of my dark past and trauma using art. I experienced extreme physical abuse by my mother and sexual abuse with her husband. With no support, I resorted to drugs and alcohol to cope with the rejection and pain. I found myself pregnant at 14 years of age, with no place to go. My childhood, coupled with my experiences of violence and sexual abuse as an adult, left unresolved trauma and emotional pain. I did not have any healthy coping skills, so I continued on a downward spiral of hardcore substance abuse and violence in all of my relationships.<p>I&#39;ve had some of my best breakthrough&#39;s creating art. During my last Windows workshop, while creating a footprint to reflect my past, I was overcome with emotion when I made the connection between my past, where I am today and where I will go in the future. After taking time to process my creations, I not only felt better, but empowered!</p><p>While creating art, I discover things like, what I needed back then, how far I have come, the good that evolved out of painful experiences and how lucky I am to be the person I am today. My life means something today. I am very lucky to have a 6-year-old daughter who is enjoying her childhood. I allow her to get dirty, be herself, and play as much as possible... everything I never got to do.</p><p>I really appreciate AWBW. Thank you for listening to and sharing with me. Being heard is powerful.</p><br />

Timmy has been coming to the AWBW children&#39;s group since we started the program back up. Timmy comes from a large family and has 2 older and 2 younger siblings. Timmy&#39;s self-esteem was very low and had a lot of negative self-talk along with anger issues. Whenever Timmy created art in group, his was usually the most expressive - it always took Timmy a while to get into doing the project but the outcome always amazed us. Now Timmy looks forward to AWBW and even made us a special &quot;Thank You&quot; card with wonderful kind words to us and most importantly, to himself. Timmy smiles more and shares eagerly with the other kids!<br />

I had been working with Susan for a few months before we did this art project. She was always really shy and never wanted to share her art. She and her family left our shelter and went into our Transitional program. In this particular project I had three teen girls. I did the warm up and explained the project. I noticed Susan was having a hard time with making her crown. I asked her what was wrong and she stated that she really didn&#39;t know what words to write on her crown. I then began to tell her that there were many words to describe her, to begin with she was a beautiful, brilliant girl, she was friendly and had a beautiful smile that would brighten up the room. She then began to make her crown. At the end she told me, &quot;The hardest part of this project was writing positive things about myself because at home no one tells me anything positive about myself. Thank you Mrs. Flor for making me feel good about myself today.&quot; I gave her a hug and told her she was a very special young lady with a beautiful heart. This art project really helped her realize the beautiful person she is.

I have dreamed of starting a support group for LGBTQ-abuse in the DV services for a long time! As often as the DV community has acknowledged that the LGBTQ population is under-served, there seems to have been little movement within existing DV programs to actually create LGBTQ-specific services. It feels as if everything is a barrier from funding to space to staff-resources to inadequate services.<br /><br />Despite this pushback, I try to facilitate an environment of tolerance and respect for everyone in the open groups. However, there have been homophobic comments and heterosexual biases that have compromised the emotional safety of the group atmosphere. To my pleasant surprise, Haven Hills - Outreach began holding networking meetings, staff trainings, community surveys, etc. to explore launching an effective LGBTQ DV support group. <br />&nbsp;<br />When the <a href="http://icanwecan.awbw.org/" target="_blank"><em>I CAN WE CAN</em></a> project came about, I was offering the workshops in the support groups I lead and in the general community. We facilitated a workshop for our staff and volunteers and I created my <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=3014&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=i+can+we+can&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"> <em>I CAN WE CAN</em></a> hand to reflect my wish of creating a safe space for LGBTQ survivors to discuss their intimate partner violence. <br />&nbsp;<br />In a beautiful coincidence, on the night of the San Pedro opening of the ICWC exhibit, I got the official word that my dream had come true: I could begin implementing the support groups! Though there is still a lot of work to do to advertise the program and expand the services, the I CAN is finally coming true :)<br />

An additional 120 students will be added to the program in their last session!

Once the Desert Sanctuary Executive Director promised the city council an event for Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention month, Eunice promptly took the reins and began planning.<br /><p>After being inspired by the <a href="http://onebillionrising.org/" target="_blank">One Billion Rising<

/a> campaign, Eunice contacted Barstow High School, hoping to make the greatest impact with their target audience. She was immediately put in touch with a teacher, who is also a dance instructor, and five of her students (aged 12 to 14) quickly learned the &quot;<a href="http://onebillionrising.org/pages/video-downloads" target="_blank">Break the Chain</a>&quot; dance.</p><p>Eunice began facilitating the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=3014&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=i+can+we+can&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">I CAN WE CAN</a> and <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2909&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=clothesline&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">The Clothesline Project</a> workshops with the teen moms she works with, the women&#39;s support group, and the AWBW shelter group. They created 30 t-shirts in total that were proudly displayed at the Exhibit in the Boy&#39;s Gym at Barstow High School. These t-shirts and the peaceful statement piece the young women performed in front of the city council and at the One Billion Rising event helped to represent the significance of the issue of domestic violence/sexual assault and the serious need for change. Eunice shared, &quot;For teenagers, one in three relationships is abusive. I think the message we&#39;re going to dance to today is very important because our teenagers are...our future.&quot;</p><p>On February 14, there were 50 people (families and young people) all in attendance at the One Billion Rising event through word of mouth! Peggi Fries, the Executive Director at Desert Sanctuary introduced the event: &quot;This is <a href="http://www.vday.org/home" target="_blank">V Day</a>. This is One Billion Rising. This is globally an effort for all people...to dance, to honor, and to recognize one billion victims of intimate partner violence, domestic violence, and sexual assault... Hopefully everyone is going to get up and do something.&quot; Something <em>was </em>done; the event was featured on the front page of the &quot;Desert Dispatch,&quot; the Barstow local newspaper, and the dance performance for the city council was posted online at the Barstow City Council website.</p><p>Mary Seilski, Former Chamber of Commerce President stated, &quot;We may have been few, but we made up for it in passion! Next year will be bigger!&quot; <br /></p><p>One featured artist shared, &quot;I felt privileged to do art for the One Billion Rising event. As an artist you always want your art to have a sense of purpose, whether to educate, convey an idea or evoke emotion, whether individually or a group, there should be a sense of enlightenment. Displaying art for one billion rising had a strong significance [for me] as a woman because it showed a sense of honor and self worth. ...I wanted to display a sense of strength that was not behind closed doors and convey that it is OK to let your voice be heard...and breaking free and standing up for yourself.&quot;</p>

<![CDATA[
ot; in February. In our rural Colorado mountain town, progressive events like this are a rarity and the opportunity for Archuleta County Victim Assistance Program to partner with PCA in this effort could not be missed.<br /><p>The PCA, equipped with a gallery space as well as a theater space, was the perfect location to organize a Survivors&#39; Art Exhibit that would run concurrently with the production. It is our hope that by presenting a multi-media event, we will have the opportunity to further raise awareness in our community around the impact of all forms of violence - particularly domestic violence and sexual violence - on the survivor, family members, and the entire community. This unique endeavor, in which we are partnering with A Window Between Worlds, provides wonderful ways for our clients to break the silence, speak out about their experiences, facilitate expression, processing, and healing through artwork. </p><p>I facilitated the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2589&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=power+shields&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"><em>Power Shields</em></a> workshop, to be displayed at the PCA, with our adult clients. The women opened themselves up to the creative process and expressed the ways in which they are and can be powerful in the world. Knowing their work will be displayed as a way of telling the community how their experiences have impacted them excites them! <br /></p><p>Teens participated in this art experience and we will offer this workshop to members of the community as well, giving those who have been affected by violence the opportunity to give voice to that experience through art and to be seen in the community for the totality of their experience. <br /></p><p>Finally, a call for art was also put out to our community; so many survivors already have (or would love to create) artwork that has been a meaningful part of their process in healing from violence. It is our hope that these art pieces will be a poignant voice to raise awareness against domestic violence and that each of the participants will experience empowerment through the process.</p><p>Opening night of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; and the Survivors Art Exhibit will be a community awareness-raising event. Our Executive Director, Carmen Hubbs, will lead a panel discussion after the performance providing an opportunity to educate our community regarding violence and its effects on all. The discussion will also examine the ways in which our attitudes towards gender (which the theater production so powerfully highlights) affect acts of violence, hopefully spurring community members into action in promoting efforts to put an end to it. <br /></p><p>This is a very exciting event for our agency and our aim is that the community will be deeply affected by the performance, discussion and survivor stories and will further support our efforts in supporting survivors of violence. This serious issue affects all of us and we need to work together to create lasting change for the future and to keep everyone safe. <br /></p><p>This is a deeply personal project for me as well. As a survivor and the mother of three daughters, it is very powerful to be part of an event that breaks through the silence that surrounds violence and heals the shame. I hope that my daughters never have to experience the shame that can accompany such victimization. All of my efforts are with the hope that they can experience a world where such violence is not tolerated.<br /></p>

We are fortunate enough to have a room dedicated to the youth group in our new facility. I painted a large bare branched tree (Community Story Tree) in the corner of the room with the intention of having youth participants place their unique painted hand prints on the tree at our final graduation session.<br /><br />On March 26th, our first round of participants graduated from their 8-week Kids Count! group and they were SO excited to paint their hands and contribute a &quot;leaf&quot; to our new community tree. Some of the children commented that, for several weeks, they had been scoping out exactly which branch they wanted to place their hand print on<br /><br />Generally a pizza party is the highlight of our Kids Count! graduation sessions... but not this time. Contributing their personalized hand prints to our beautiful tree was definitely the most memorable event according to the kids (and staff!) who participated. I can&#39;t wait to see this tree grow and change as group after group of children and teens graduate from our programs.&nbsp; <br />

As part of their Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative and their Enrichment Services program, Habitat for Humanity San Fernando/Santa Clarita Valleys (SF/SCV), has partnered with A Window Between Worlds (AWBW), to bring healing art workshops to the students at Bowman High School in Santa Clarita.<br /><br />Over the last 7 weeks, over 500 Bowman High students have participated in more than 31 AWBW workshops focusing on topics to help students express their emotions through art. These projects included: <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2942&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=stepping+stones&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Stepping Stones</a>, <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2984&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=relation&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Looking at Relationships Collage</a>, <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2932&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=relation&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">My Relationship Boundaries... Revealed for Teens!</a>, <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=3010&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=the+reasons&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">The Reasons We Smile</a>, <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2699&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=book&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">A Book About Me</a>, <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2688&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=funeral&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Funeral of &quot;I Cant&#39;s&quot;</a>, and more!&nbsp; <br /><br />The facilitators of these workshops (Pamela Braly and assisted by Teresa Simpson, Natalie Coleman and Susan Contreras) have received the Community Award from Bowman High School and are receiving excellent feedback from the student population. Several even hope to continue participating in workshops after the session ends at Bowman High.<p>This program was brought to the school after Habitat learned that many Bowman High School students have loved ones currently serving or recently returning from U.S. Military deployment and several tours of duty. Other participants have no immediate veteran family members but have experienced a loss of a loved one or other traumatic experiences at a young age.</p><p>As an &quot;enrichment&quot; partner of Habitat for Humanity SF/SCV, A Window Between Worlds provides healing art programs for these adults and children recovering from abuse and traumatic experiences. An additional 120 students will be added to the program in their last session! <br /></p><p>&quot;Thank you for coming to our school and teaching me that it&#39;s fine to be open, like for real you ladies helped me with that. I&#39;ve changed who I hang out with. I&#39;m not as materialistic as I used to be. This class has changed me for the better. Thanks a bunch.&quot;</p><br />

I have been running the Windows art workshops for three months now and have seen how much the children have gained from participating in them. The children I serve are enrolled in the preschool program at our licensed childcare facility. This facility offers childcare services that meet specific needs for our clients. The children are learning how to problem solve and interact with one another without violence.<br /><br />Prior to the workshops, there were two children who were identified as having extreme behaviors - they would have tantrums, scream, throw things, hit, and kick at least once a week. <br /><br />One of the two children would try to be controlling over the other children and not want to share. As a result of the art workshops, I have noticed a growth in him. He is now inclusive with the other children and is willing to share toys and participate in other activities with his classmates.&nbsp; The &ldquo;<a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2593&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=feeling&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Feelings Faces</a>&rdquo; art workshop was very helpful in the beginning to express how he felt inside. He also enjoyed &ldquo;<a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2624&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=this+is+me&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">This is Me</a>&rdquo; because he was able to write and see his name and was proud of that.<br /><br /><p>Since implementing the art workshops, all of the children have become more verbal; they&#39;re able to use their words or pictures to express themselves, and focus on the artwork. <br /></p>The two children with extreme behaviors have also decreased their aggression. The positive reinforcement and non-judgmental approach AWBW offers has helped to build their self-confidence, their ability to communicate with one another, and have a sense of pride in their creations. It has been a joy and an inspiration to watch them grow every week.<br /><br />

Mikey suffered severe physical and mental abuse for the first 13 years of his life. There were several occasions where his father would not allow him to drink water, would keep him locked in a room, and would monitor all his activities with installed house surveillance cameras. Worst of all, he would physically abuse his son while shouting vulgar obscenities toward him.<br /><br />Obviously, this abuse has had many negative consequences on Mikey. During group, he appeared nervous, unsure of himself and had very little to say. His first AWBW project said it all: he penciled in a young man shielding his entire face with a mask of an animal. At the end of this particular workshop, Mikey appeared pleased with the creativity that flowed from him. I believe that as a direct result of AWBW art, Mikey was able to find his medium of communication.<br /><br />I am happy to announce that Mikey finished the WSLB Youth Program last month. On his last day, we discussed youth activism that centered on teen dating violence, along with the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=3016&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=i+can+we+can&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">I CAN WE CAN</a> project. He firmly stated, &quot;I believe in creating awareness around teen dating violence issues.&quot; A week later, he came to the community I CAN event and made his piece which said, &quot;I can forgive but not forget.&quot;<br /><br />It brings me great joy to know that AWBW art projects have been the catalyst toward Mikey&rsquo;s journey of expression and forgiveness. I believe that art will be a part of him for a long time and I am excited to see where the next level of his growth takes him.&nbsp; <br /><br />To learn more about the I CAN WE CAN project and movement, see the article at left. To see more powerful and inspiring hands from around the world, see our I CAN WE CAN gallery by <a href="http://icanwecan.awbw.org/galleries/i-can-we-can-community-wall#.US5WNxl8zqc" target="_blank">clicking here!<br /></a> <p>&nbsp;</p><br />

John was an extremely introverted 16-year old whose refusal to participate in group sessions was commonplace. He preferred sitting in the corner by himself to joining in the healing art workshops; that is, until I introduced <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2536&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=monster&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"><em>The Monster in Me</em></a>. This was the first workshop in which he was willing to participate. John&rsquo;s art turned out to be altogether chilling and profound. <br /><br />After the painting had dried and he was able to step back and internalize his art, John proclaimed, &quot;I didn&rsquo;t realize how many demons <br />I was fighting.&quot;<br /><br />I encourage my clients to delve into examining what every portion of their monster represents. From this exercise, John was finally able to view his struggles from a more objective standpoint, providing him with the insight and tools to sort his feelings and begin his healing.<br /><br />Prior to his participation in <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2536&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=monster&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"><em>The </em><em>Monster in Me</em></a> workshop, John&rsquo;s therapist had begun to lose hope for any sort of emotional redemption. After the workshop, John began to willingly attend every single therapy session and eagerly speak about all of his issues. <br /><br />If it weren&rsquo;t for <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2536&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=monster&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"><em>The</em> <em>Monster in Me</em></a>, John would not have opened up the way he did, allowing himself to finally and fully feel his sadness, begin to release his anger, and embark on an affirmative journey of healing.<br />

I did the Warm Fuzzy workshop with three siblings, ranging from ages 7-12. These children experienced verbal and emotional abuse at home for approximately 6 years (directed at both their mother and them).<br /><br />The family was referred to us for therapy and case management services. I worked with the middle child, an 11- year-old boy, who would stand up to the stepfather in his mother&#39;s defense. This child was experiencing problems with anxiety and all three children were exhibiting behavioral issues. There was also a lot of conflict and arguing among the siblings at the beginning of treatment.<br /><br />The children listened attentively as I read a version of the Warm Fuzzies story and became immediately engaged in creating their fuzzies.<br /><br />The 7-year old sister initially asked for help in making her first fuzzy, but quickly realized she was capable of making it herself. The oldest brother offered her words of encouragement and the middle brother offered to help her tie her fuzzy. The brothers praised how fluffy her fuzzies were coming out and began to incorporate some of her ideas into their own work. They were each able to articulate what they liked about each others&#39; fuzzies. At the end, the children asked if they could keep all their warm fuzzies and laughed when reminded that warm fuzzies are meant to be shared. They agreed to be affectionate with others, while still holding on to their &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; feeling inside.<br /><br />The workshop provided a safe environment for the children to practice the skills they had been learning in therapy, and to experience the benefits. They were able to give and receive praise and encouragement and see how good it feels. It was a fun, neutral setting, where they could focus on the art and not each other, or on fighting for mom&#39;s attention.<br /><br />In the Warm Fuzzy story, the characters begin to give each other cold pricklies to stay alive after people start to shrivel up and die from the lack of warm fuzzies. However, the pricklies didn&#39;t make them feel as good as the warm fuzzies did. <br /><br />It was great to see the siblings cooperating and helping each other in making the fuzzies, and having them recognize the meaning behind it. The siblings realized that when they fight or argue, they are giving each other cold pricklies, which &quot;keep them alive&quot; by creating some kind of connection between them, but they don&#39;t feel as good as when they are giving each other warm fuzzies and being kind and loving toward each other.

The children are given the opportunity to freely and creatively express their feelings, share their talents, and regain their sense of self-confidence and voice.<br /><br />This &quot;sanctuary anchored in hope&quot; represents the safety, security, peace, and protection that the children need when coming from a domestic violence situation. Offering an alternative mode to express oneself relieves stress and tension as well as provides a safe and positive way to process anger and other difficult feelings. Given the opportunity to communicate in a non-verbal manner, the entire well-being of a child can be improved.<br /><br />Through the modality of art, many children are able to share their voice and what is in their heart for the first time. In a group setting, they are able to connect with one another through encouraging and sharing with each other. Rather than worrying about what makes them different, art celebrates what is special about each individual and gives the children a common ground to embrace both themselves and the others. The Children&#39;s Windows curriculum of workshops reflect and meet the needs, transitions, feelings, and transformations that the students make on a daily basis!<br /><br />

While the conversations between the children were sometimes jarring, I loved seeing the children relax, create, interact, and enjoy the art workshops.<br /><br /></span><span class="plaintext">Our kids have experienced domestic violence and often abuse and/or neglect due to alcohol and drug abuse in the home. One 6-year old witnessed the abuser strangling her mom in front of her and three siblings.<br /><br />I did the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2816&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=sculpey&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Sculpey Expression Faces</a> workshop with four children, ages 4 to 8. Before the project started, the kids made faces in the mirror to see how their mouth and eyes would change if they were angry, happy, scared or sad. We shared examples of when the kids experienced these different feelings, like being happy at birthdays, scared during thunderstorms, or sad when mommy and daddy fight. <br /><br /></span><span class="plaintext">The children were working intently on finishing their Sculpey faces. While creating, the 6-year old girl quietly shared, &quot;My daddy tried to kill my mommy. Now I am having nightmares about blood coming out of her neck where he put his hands and choked her.&quot; Others at the table nodded and said they were having bad dreams too. One boy put his head down and started to cry. He wondered why he was missing his daddy so much when he saw him hurt his mommy. <br /></span><br /><span class="plaintext"><span class="plaintext">We talked about how scary it is to see violence in the family and how it is not the children&#39;s fault when this happens. This conversation was started because the boy who was crying shared that he thought it was his fault because he had been naughty. The conversation that followed between the children, led to the conclusion that it is NOT OK for a man to hurt a women. The oldest boy said, &quot;Daddies have to stop hurting Mommies.&quot;<br /><br />I was able to connect with the children on a deeper level as a result of the art workshop. The project encouraged a conversation between the children about the domestic violence they experienced. The communication seemed to release emotions that the kids had bottled up inside them. <br /></span></span><br /><span class="plaintext"><span class="plaintext"><span class="plaintext">All the children want more art and approach me when I arrive at shelter to do more workshops. The oldest boy thinks he will be an artist when he grows up. His sculpey face quote says, &quot;Art makes me happy!&quot;</span></span></span>

A four-year-old named Cindy was exposed to domestic violence in her home. Her mother experienced extreme physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by the child&rsquo;s father. The child was present in the majority of the physical and verbal incidents, as well as the aftermath of each incident. She would very often witness mom crying, bleeding or curled up in a ball on the floor. <br /><br />During a parent-teacher conference, mom confided in Cindy&#39;s brother John&rsquo;s 1st grade teacher. She disclosed all of the abuse she endured on a daily basis. With the support of John&rsquo;s teacher and with the help of a social worker newly assigned to ensure the children&rsquo;s safety, mom and the family entered our emergency shelter. &nbsp;<br /><br />Shelter staff referred Cindy for counseling services after they observed her depression-like symptoms. The child would isolate herself from others, refused to talk, and lacked energy and interest in the activities that other kids her age enjoyed participating in.<br /><br />When I first met Cindy, she was guarded and nonverbal. I wanted to provide the child with a safe environment in which she felt like she was the most important person. <br /><br />The Crowned With Esteem workshop was facilitated as a termination activity. The crown served as a symbolic reminder of the positive qualities Cindy discovered about herself that made her lovable. After the workshop, she held her head higher and appeared to be more confident. She even walked differently. I encouraged Cindy to wear her crown on the days when she needed reminding of just how special and important she is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Just like a princess,&rsquo; Cindy stated. I replied, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right. You are a princess and never forget that!&rsquo;<br /><br />I believe that the time Cindy spent in session with me and with the shelter staff (receiving acknowledgment, encouragement, praise, and reflection) will have lasting affects. I saw Cindy the day her family was exiting our program and she was wearing her crown. Her confidence radiated through her pores!<br /><br />

Last week I had a 10-year-old boy in group who was really struggling with behavior issues, not only in my group, but in school as well. He had been banned from field trips for the week because he was swearing at a girl in class and making a very inappropriate gesture. In group last week he was very cruel to the same girl and called her names. Even after repeated attempts to redirect him, he continued to talk back and be very disrespectful. I had to ask him to leave group after only 10 minutes. <br /><br />I truly feel that we were able to connect with him through the art. It was a safe environment for him to express himself and make connections with others as well.<br /><br />This week he was a completely different child. He fully participated in group, helped the other kids, and was very polite. He shared a lot without any resistance and wanted to do group more than once a week. When we did the workshop The Center of My World, he was so excited to share his creation with the the other children. Right as we were about to wrap up, he found another word that he wanted to add to his creation. The word was &quot;Art.&quot; He explained that he chose that word because he likes to sketch. He then proceeded to show the whole group how he can sketch. <br /><br />Later in the evening his mother approached me and asked how her son had done in group. I shared that he was wonderful to have and that I wanted to look for a sketchpad for him. She shared that she did not know that her son liked to sketch. I gave him the sketchpad and only a few minutes later he was running up to the desk to thank me and to show me his sketches. He was so proud of himself and I was too.<br /><br />t was so rewarding to see him so happy. He has been through so much in his life and really struggles to make connections with people. He is very sensitive, especially to any perceived put-down or joke at his expense, and so it was very brave of him to reveal to the group that he likes to sketch.<br /><br />&nbsp;I am so grateful for these workshops.

Then they decorated small hexagonal boxes with paint and collage in which to keep the suggestions, to draw out when they felt stressed. <br /><br />A week later, Jennifer shared this story with me: <br />She told me that she felt a little bad because the week before she had been kind of &quot;flip&quot; about the group (although I hadn&#39;t noticed she had been!). She also said that during the week, she&#39;d had a really bad morning. She was feeling stressed, her kids were out of control, and she was having a really hard time keeping perspective and controlling her temper.<br /><br />When one of her kids swooped by her, she grabbed for him, but instead knocked the little <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2739&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=self&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Self-Care Box</a> onto the floor. She said, &quot;It was like slow motion. The lid came off and those little orange slips came out and all landed FACE UP, so I could read them.

It was powerful.&nbsp; And it was on the day before my 50th birthday.&quot; <br /><br />She then gave me a huge hug and said, &quot;I will never forget this.&quot; It gave me goosebumps, and so I wanted to share this story with you!<br />

One of the first AWBW workshops we did on campus was the shrink art activity for the <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=3038&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=I+CAN+WE+CAN&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">I CAN WE CAN </a> Day of Action. <br /><br />We hosted a table outside the dining hall during lunchtime and engaged students as they were coming and going. The shrink art activity was what first attracted the students, since for most of them it was something very new and different. But after learning about the purpose of the activity and how we wanted them to participate, many of our students became even more excited.<br /><br />It was great to see students coloring on shrink art paper up against walls, seeing them crowded around tables, and sitting on the floor being very mindful and deliberate with their <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=3038&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=I+CAN+WE+CAN&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">I CAN WE CAN</a> statements and designs. As they worked, some students felt comfortable sharing their personal stories of how sexual violence has impacted their lives, while others just sat quietly and worked on their art. Only a few students decided to take their shrink art with them, but most wanted their artwork to be shared and sent off into the world so that their message can be seen by others.<br /><br />Today, we are still finding <a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=3038&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=I+CAN+WE+CAN&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">I CAN WE CAN</a> shrink art around campus and we&#39;re glad that we have a student body that wants to create a campus that&#39;s free of violence.  <br />&nbsp;<br />

<p align="left">&quot;I had been working with a 19-year-old female client for about six months, doing many interventions to try and process her trauma story. She was very resistant to treatment and to any of the AWBW activities. She had been invited to group session in order for her to relate to other women, but refused. She suffered from anxiety and some depressive symptoms as the result of the domestic violence experienced.</p> As I searched for interventions on the AWBW workshop list, I came across <a href="http://awbw.org/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2952&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=unity+symbols&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Family Unity Symbols</a>. I made a modification for the client to express feelings through the scribbling according to each presented theme. For instance, I asked her to scribble how she felt about her sister; she was gentle and had large circles. I then asked her about her feelings towards her mother and friends, which varied.<br /><br />Lastly, I asked her about the batterer; she scribbled and scratched the colored pencil so hard, she nearly ripped the paper. She put the pencil down and began to cry. She spoke about her feelings for the first time. She talked about anger and guilt, shame and helplessness. She went on to do more valuable work in the following weeks leading to termination. At the end, she stated that her favorite parts of therapy were the ones that used art, not only because she didn&rsquo;t have to speak, but she could process more at home.&quot;<br />

I&nbsp; have been working with a 45-year old Latina woman, who has one 11-year old child. In 2012, this client was pleased to announce to our support group that she had finally started the divorce process that she had contemplated for many years. Seven months later, right before the divorce was finalized, her husband asked for another opportunity to make their marriage work. She agreed and returned home with him, hoping for her happily ever after.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Three months later, the client unexpectedly walked into our support group in tears and shared that nothing had changed. Her husband was just as verbally and psychologically abusive as before. She said she was ashamed for having &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; for his &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; again and felt that her support system was tired of her back and forth with him.<br /><br />At the time of the I CAN WE CAN project, the client was struggling with the decision of if, how, and when she should proceed with a new divorce proceeding. During the workshop, she reflected, cried, and listened. At the end of the workshop, she stated that she felt renewed and motivated. She said, &ldquo;Si yo no lo hago, quien lo va hacer por mi?&rdquo; (If I don&#39;t do it, who is going to do it for me?), &ldquo;Yo lo puedo hacer. Lo hice una vez y lo voy a lograr otra vez. Esta vez no voy a caer en su trampas otra vez.&rdquo; (I can do it. I did it once and I can do it again. This time I am not going to fall into his traps).<br /><br />And she did just that. Her divorce was finalized last month. Ultimately, she received less financial support than what she was scheduled for initially, but she said she would give all the money back in order to have the peace of mind that she has now. The client has stated that the I CAN WE CAN project gave her that final push that she needed in order to move forward with the divorce.<br />

<p>Many times we feel like we want to drop out of the game. It doesn&#39;t matter what game we choose to partake in. The hand we are dealt does not determine who we are. It&#39;s easy to bet against ourselves when we perceive others as having been dealt better cards. We forget, however, that our <br />fortune lies in the cards. One door closed is another door opened. Always say yes. Always keep playing. Children play for fun. That is how we learn until our hearts stop beating. <br /></p><p><span class="plaintext"><em>* The following is an update from Mauricio, on the I CAN hands he created: <br /></em></span></p><p>I am reminded of how each of my I CAN hands is different from the rest in the way that they look as well as the message behind them. Looking at them again made me feel proud of what I have inside. Although it is very satisfying to work with the clients that we serve at WomenShelter, it can also be trying at times. I sometimes question if I have what it takes to help the kids I work with. I suppose that is a common fear amongst those who work in providing any kind of service to a community.</p><p>The magic that these I CAN hands carry is immense. They helped to remind me that I do have what it takes. After all, my first hand tells me to never bet against myself. At the core of each of these hands is an expression of love towards myself and toward others. I am reminded once more that love is the most powerful magic of them all.</p>

e time. <br /><br />I was able to see him during the week in one-on-one time and just handed him crayons and paper. He had no desire to draw and it took some time until he was willing to start and then he worked fast and unfocused. It did not seem to make a difference. But from then on I saw him several days a week and drawing became part of our meeting time. His drawings were much the same: thick black lines, crisscrossing, a small person dead and another person with a gun in-hand, or two people&nbsp; confronting each other and one of them bleeding and everything in black. Sometimes I was able to talk with him about the picture, but many times he just wanted to be left alone. Yet, he never left without a hug and the assurance that he could come back whenever.<br /><br />One day in a group setting, B got very agitated and threatened to beat a kid. I took him aside and pulled out paper and crayons. This time he went to &quot;work&quot; without giving it any thought and drew his picture as usual. Afterwards I asked him how he felt and he said, &quot;better.&quot;&nbsp; When asked if he wanted to join the group he said &quot;no&quot;, but it was clear that he was now drained of energy and needed time alone to collect himself. Through the art he was able to be around the group without getting involved and without disturbing the rest of the group.&nbsp;

He continuously repeated phrases such as: &ldquo;You can make every color, whatever you want!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oops, it&rsquo;s okay we can just wash it off later.&rdquo; But, my favorite moment of this workshop was when he completed his heart shaped treasure box, sighed, looked at it, then at me with an incredibly proud smirk and said &ldquo;My mom&rsquo;s going to be happy with this.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">I facilitate a weekly groups for middle-school age boys (tween boys) who have experienced violence directly or indirectly. The majority of these boys come from families with domestic violence; however, all of these boys have conflict in their relationships with their biological fathers.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2630&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=Letter&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Letter to the Fathers</a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">&nbsp;was an especially profound experience for the boys - ages 10 through 12 - and created an opening for them to talk about their relationships with their fathers. For one boy (age 12), this was especially powerful. While I knew that he is estranged from his father and feels angry with him, I did not experience the full depth of the boy&#39;s feelings until this workshop. He was able to get in touch with the rage that he feels in response to his father&#39;s acts of violence. &lsquo;I wish for you to just die.&rsquo;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">It was difficult for him, as he did not want to say anything to his father - in a letter or otherwise - because of his anger. However, he was able to express this in the group setting. This has paved the way for him being increasingly honest about his feelings towards his father in the group. He regularly talks about his anger now and also his emotional pain for how his father treated him, his mother, and his sister. It has allowed him to reach a new depth of safety and support within the group setting and with the other boys and has allowed him to safely express how the domestic violence has affected him. A very powerful workshop indeed!</span><br />

<span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">&quot;During the month of December, I wanted to empower my 9-year-old client by reminding her of the positive coping skills she has to counter her negative issues (loss, anxiety, low self-esteem) brought on by the holidays. She struggles with sharing her feelings/thoughts, but is invested in counseling and AWBW directives that help her communicate. I referred to the workshop,&nbsp;</span><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2803&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=Snowflakes&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Snowflakes &ndash; Holiday with HEART Series</a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">, and created a new version to benefit my client with her unique needs. With this directive, I was able to open the door to helping her explore the significance of her holidays and to celebrate her own magical winter.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">The Disney movie&nbsp;</span><em style="text-align: -webkit-center">Frozen</em><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">symbolically connected my client&rsquo;s snowflake to the snowflakes in the movie. Part of the movie focuses on a character&rsquo;s ability to turn everything into cold ice which she sees as a curse, but eventually embraces as a&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">strength and creates the most beautiful snowflake castle. The Disney character sings about letting it go and transforms from a person running away with shame to being a person who shines and lets go of the negativity even for a minute.</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">The Affirmation Snowflake helped this child understand the science (the temperature is below freezing point) and symbolic meaning of snowflakes. AWBW has a similar directive (Pearls of Wisdom) and reminds clients that the snowflake or pearl must go through harsh negative conditions (harsh winter and freezing air/water) and the final product is beautiful and unique.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">My client shared her current negative struggles related to her DV experiences. She also identified six positive qualities&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">(affirmation list), like the six arms of the snowflake that grow independently and at different rates, and then created/decorated a one-of-a-kind snowflake reflecting her own uniqueness.&quot;</span>

Her eloquence and pain were simultaneously displayed in her describing herself as &quot;a leaf wandering and flowing through the wind&quot; with whatever mood swings her mother directed at her.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">The&nbsp;</span><a href="http://awbw.org/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2594&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=inside&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Inside Me/Outside Me</a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">Workshop allowed her to delve more deeply into her pain&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">and consequently to release that pain from her life. We began the workshop with&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">something called&nbsp;</span><a href="http://awbw.org/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2716&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=timed+&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Timed Writing,</a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">&nbsp;in which participants spill out onto paper whatever</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">comes to their minds. Jane wrote &quot;rage, argue with me,&quot; and &quot;want to start over.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">Through this portion of the workshop it became apparent she longed to gain freedom&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">from her mother&rsquo;s emotional abuse. I&rsquo;d once read somewhere that, &quot;there are no mistakes, just happy accidents.&quot; I found&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">this to be no truer than in Jane&rsquo;s art. She drew two versions of herself, both behind different windows; one, a darkly colored version with a band-aid placed upon her heart (the &quot;sad&quot; her), and one with bright colors and a smile (the &quot;new&quot; her). Both were placed high above a choppy sea on which she wrote &quot;Raige.&quot; She drew a sun lifting above the horizon, which she called &quot;Light,&quot; and in the open sky she wrote &quot;Freedom.&quot;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">For someone who was an AP student and an otherwise excellent speller, her&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">misspelling of &quot;RaIge&quot; represented to me that &quot;I&quot; was in the middle of &quot;Rage,&quot; as though she saw herself as completely ensconced in the midst of her rage and anger being a product of her mother&rsquo;s abuse. It was such a poignant and pivotal moment.</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">&nbsp;For Jane, her surprising misspelling initially caught her off guard, but she soon recognized it as her subconscious emotions coming to light. Seeing how the artwork encouraged those emotions to surface helped her begin to move forward and gave her the tools she needed to cast off her unhappiness. Jane left home and left her&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">mother&rsquo;s abuse behind and is now happily finishing her first year in the Job Corps.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">The workshop enabled her to leave the &quot;sad&quot; her behind to become the &quot;new&quot; her,&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">bright and smiling, and with no more need for the band-aid.</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://awbw.org/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2594&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=inside&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">Inside Me/Outside Me</a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">represented how using different and creative ways of</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">expressing one&rsquo;s feelings can release hidden, trapped emotions and unlock new and</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">freeing beginnings.

them to hear, I assured them that there was a brighter side to my news. I explained that I was going to remain connected to them through the wonderful art workshops they&rsquo;d become familiar with. By the time our conversation was over, they understood that I had been chosen to become part of something big, something important, something that would change the lives of many children, just like them, across the country. With smiles on their faces, they thanked me and wished me luck.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">My name is Rudy Hernandez and I am the new Children&rsquo;s Program Coordinator for A Window Between Worlds (AWBW).<br />&nbsp;<br />Over the past three years I&#39;ve had the pleasure to work with AWBW through my position at Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Crisis Shelter (WCCS) in Los Angeles County. As the Children&rsquo;s Case Manager, I transformed the children&rsquo;s program into a thriving community of healing through the ongoing training and support of AWBW. During my first leadership training, I was introduced to AWBW&rsquo;s mission and I have been on board ever since, spreading their message of hope in my classroom and in many other aspects of my life. After leading hundreds of workshops, I strengthened my skills and began to contribute workshops of my own, which leaders have been using in their programs for over two years. In recent months, I&#39;ve created a community outreach program for WCCS, which started with a successful I CAN WE CAN event at their annual 5K Fitness Walk where over 250 people created their artistic pledges to speak out against abuse. Through these experiences, I have devoted myself to AWBW and I was honored to be chosen to become a member of the staff.<br />&nbsp;<br />As Children&rsquo;s Program Coordinator, it will be my job to support all Children&rsquo;s Windows leaders in every aspect of program implementation. Having been trained under the outstanding leadership of Cheryl Silver, I walk into this position knowing that I&#39;ve learned from the best and will continue to do so. It is my goal to transform my passion into hard work and I will dedicate myself to this organization that has been the source of my inspiration. We will be the beacon of hope and the catalyst for change in the lives of many children as we learn and grow together. I am excited about our new endeavors and I look forward to great things to come! Now, put your hands up and give me a high five because this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: -webkit-center">A Window Between World&rsquo;s workshops have been extremely beneficial to the kids who come into our Education Center. The time they spend doing the workshops are positive significant moments in their lives in which they are able to have freedom, peace, and control over their emotions and release any tension they have felt throughout the day. Doing art helps them open up more about their lives and about who they are without being afraid or feeling indifferent.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">The VIP-CMHC is a multidisciplinary program for the evaluation, treatment and investigation of child abuse and neglect. Today, it remains the largest child abuse center in California. VIP-CMHC aims to treat the effects of all types of abuse, while also emphasizing community-based prevention to end the cycle of family violence.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">A workshop that the kids love doing is&nbsp;<a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2536&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=monster&amp;submit.x=35&amp;submit.y=5" target="_blank">The Monster in Me</a>. Teaching them about monsters and about the many conventional and unconventional emotions that define a &ldquo;monster&rdquo; gave them a new perspective. Through their artwork they demonstrated many monster faces: scary, ugly, silly, happy, and sweet. They also had a lot of fun using the cray-pas and watercolors.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">Our youth in the center have endless joy when doing AWBW workshops. The time they spend making art are happy moments in their day that help them cope with the sadness, fears, and struggles they face in their lives. A whole world of possibilities opens up to them when they create something. They hold their piece of art up high and show it to their parents, therapists, and other kids in the room and feel the admiration and praise of all.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">That is the healing that AWBW workshops bring to our children at VIP. They are able to communicate with confidence, sharing their experiences and feelings through their art.&nbsp; Because of the support that AWBW provides us with, our kids have a positive future ahead.&nbsp;<br /></p><div><br /></div>

He also enjoyed &ldquo;<a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2624&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=this+is+me&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">This is Me</a>&rdquo; because he was able to write and see his name and was proud of that.<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">Since implementing the art workshops, all of the children have become more verbal; they&#39;re able to use their words or pictures to express themselves, and focus on the artwork.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">The two children with extreme behaviors have also decreased their aggression. The positive reinforcement and non-judgmental approach AWBW offers has helped to build their self-confidence, their ability to communicate with one another, and have a sense of pride in their creations. It has been a joy and an inspiration to watch them grow every week.</p>

<span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">Mikey suffered severe physical and mental abuse for the first 13 years of his life. There were several occasions where his father would not allow him to drink water, would keep him locked in a room, and would monitor all his activities with installed house surveillance cameras. Worst of all, he would physically abuse his son while shouting vulgar obscenities toward him.</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">Obviously, this abuse has had many negative consequences on Mikey. During group, he appeared nervous, unsure of himself and had very little to say. His first AWBW project said it all: he penciled in a young man shielding his entire face with a mask of an animal. At the end of this particular workshop, Mikey appeared pleased with the creativity that flowed from him. I believe that as a direct result of AWBW art, Mikey was able to find his medium of communication.</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">I am happy to announce that Mikey finished the WSLB Youth Program last month. On his last day, we discussed youth activism that centered on teen dating violence, along with the&nbsp;</span><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=3016&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=i+can+we+can&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank">I CAN WE CAN</a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">project. He firmly stated, &quot;I believe in creating awareness around teen dating violence issues.&quot; A week later, he came to the community I CAN event and made his piece which said, &quot;I can forgive but not forget.&quot;</span><div><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">It brings me great joy to know that AWBW art projects have been the catalyst toward Mikey&rsquo;s journey of expression and forgiveness. I believe that art will be a part of him for a long time and I am excited to see where the next level of his growth takes him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">To learn more about the I CAN WE CAN project and movement, see the article at left.

<![CDATA[
<p style="text-align: -webkit-center">The Pagosa Center for the Arts (PCA) and Thingamajig Theater are offering a wonderful opportunity to further raise awareness in our small community about the effects of violence on women and girls by presenting &quot;<a href="http://www.vday.org/about" target="_blank">The Vagina Monologues</a>&quot; in February. In our rural Colorado mountain town, progressive events like this are a rarity and the opportunity for Archuleta County Victim Assistance Program to partner with PCA in this effort could not be missed.</p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">The PCA, equipped with a gallery space as well as a theater space, was the perfect location to organize a Survivors&#39; Art Exhibit that would run concurrently with the production. It is our hope that by presenting a multi-media event, we will have the opportunity to further raise awareness in our community around the impact of all forms of violence - particularly domestic violence and sexual violence - on the survivor, family members, and the entire community. This unique endeavor, in which we are partnering with A Window Between Worlds, provides wonderful ways for our clients to break the silence, speak out about their experiences, facilitate expression, processing, and healing through artwork.</p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">I facilitated the&nbsp;<a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2589&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=1&amp;searchtext=power+shields&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"><em>Power Shields</em></a>Women&#39;s Windows workshop, to be displayed at the PCA, with our adult clients. The women opened themselves up to the creative process and expressed the ways in which they are and can be powerful in the world. Knowing their work will be displayed as a way of telling the community how their experiences have impacted them excites them!<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">Teens participated in this art experience and we will offer this workshop to members of the community as well, giving those who have been affected by violence the opportunity to give voice to that experience through art and to be seen in the community for the totality of their experience.&nbsp;<br /></p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center">Finally, a call for art was also put out to our community; so many survivors already have (or would love to create) artwork that has been a meaningful part of their process in healing from violence. It is our hope that these art pieces will be a poignant voice to raise awareness against domestic violence and that each of the participants will experience empowerment through the process.</p><p style="text-align: -webkit-center"><span style="background-color: #d4dbe5">Opening night of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; and the Survivors Art Exhibit will be a community awareness-raising event. Our Executive Director, Carmen Hubbs, will lead a panel discussion after the performance providing an opportunity to educate our community regarding violence and its effects on all. The discussion will also examine the ways in which our attitudes towards gender (which the theater production so powerfully highlights) affect acts of violence, hopefully spurring community members into action in promoting efforts to put an end to it.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: #d4dbe5">This is a very exciting event for our agency and our aim is that the community will be deeply affected by the performance, discussion and survivor stories and will further support our efforts in supporting survivors of violence. This serious issue affects all of us and we need to work together to create lasting change for the future and to keep everyone safe.</span><br /><br /><span style="background-color: #d4dbe5">This is a deeply personal project for me as well. As a survivor and the mother of three daughters, it is very powerful to be part of an event that breaks through the silence that surrounds violence and heals the shame. I hope that my daughters never have to experience the shame that can accompany such victimization. All of my efforts are with the hope that they can experience a world where such violence is not tolerated.</span><br /></p>

<span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">John was an extremely introverted 16-year old whose refusal to participate in group sessions was commonplace. He preferred sitting in the corner by himself to joining in the healing art workshops; that is, until I introduced&nbsp;</span><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2536&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=monster&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"><em>The Monster in Me</em></a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">. This was the first workshop in which he was willing to participate. John&rsquo;s art turned out to be altogether chilling and profound.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">After the painting had dried and he was able to step back and internalize his art, John proclaimed, &quot;I didn&rsquo;t realize how many demons&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">I was fighting.&quot;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">I encourage my clients to delve into examining what every portion of their monster represents. From this exercise, John was finally able to view his struggles from a more objective standpoint, providing him with the insight and tools to sort his feelings and begin his healing.</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">Prior to his participation in&nbsp;</span><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2536&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=monster&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"><em>The</em><em>Monster in Me</em></a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">&nbsp;workshop, John&rsquo;s therapist had begun to lose hope for any sort of emotional redemption. After the workshop, John began to willingly attend every single therapy session and eagerly speak about all of his issues.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">If it weren&rsquo;t for&nbsp;</span><a href="/awbw/workshop.php?workshopid=2536&amp;dosearch=1&amp;windowstypeid=2&amp;searchtext=monster&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0" target="_blank"><em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Monster in Me</em></a><span style="text-align: -webkit-center; background-color: #d4dbe5">, John would not have opened up the way he did, allowing himself to finally and fully feel his sadness, begin to release his anger, and embark on an affirmative journey of healing.</span><br />

My creation of &lsquo;Changing your Baggage&rsquo; is a current reflection of where I&rsquo;ve come from in my life and where I want to go in the future. The baggage I carried with me before was heavy with &lsquo;rocks&rsquo; of self-hate, constant depression, rejection, denial, and the self-belief that &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not good enough.&rsquo;<br /><br />Rocks represent the weight I have carried a majority of my life, but over the rocks are clouds that are helping these &lsquo;rocks&rsquo; feel lighter&hellip; having healthy boundaries in my life verses being in denial of my feelings and not voicing them.&nbsp; Growth has helped keep me from staying depressed about the situation or life itself. &nbsp;<br /><br />My son&rsquo;s father was a very heavy rock for me, but the support I&rsquo;ve received from the shelter and the Windows workshops have helped me slowly chip away at this rock and make it lighter, and in the process make me stronger. I am slowly learning to love myself, and it has helped to put out the thoughts of &lsquo;not being good enough.&rsquo; Often times I have felt rejected, but I have found that my determination can counter this. Deep down, I am a fighter. <br /><br />On the outside of the luggage I placed &lsquo;stickers&rsquo; of where I want to go such as Hawaii, UCLA, and owning my own home.&nbsp; My rocks are still there but all you see are my big clouds of hope!
