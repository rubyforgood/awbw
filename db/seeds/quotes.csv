226,"On the front of the doll, the Holy Spirit is a star; the colors of the fabric and the yellow jewel represents the rain, the wind, and Jesus.  Each of these materials hangs from stands of various fabrics, red, bold blue, and royal in color.  The color turquoise is equal to Heaven and is represented in the purity on the waist band of the angel.

Soul-Mate Tear Doll,,,,

This is my real best friend.  I donít know where sheís taking me but itís OK because sheís always smiling.  her color is light blue because itís calming.

\,,,,
,,,,
\,,,,
One-Eyed-Doll,,,,
\,,,,
This doll is me right now.  I put wore in her hands because she needs the wire for support and to face problems.  The star above her heart represents my son because he is in my heart.  There are round brass pieces on the back of my tear-catcher doll and these represent the parents who support me. The face of my doll has only one eye.  This is the eye she will be looking through for her future husband/mate. (She winked) Iím going to be very careful next time! (She laughed and made her point that judgment is essential!),,,,

233,"I am so excited about how the kids stay focused and involved for the entire workshop!

(I told her itís okay, you donít have to if you feel uncomfortable), she said, ìNo, its okay I can do it!î  She cried as she did her monster picture and was the first one done.  When I asked if anyone wanted to share with us, she was the first one to share.  She cried and told us how she was sexually molested as a child (sheís now 56) and how hurt she is.  She says she canít get over it.",0,,
240,My monster has a smiley face because sometimes monsters pretend they are nice but they are really mean on the inside.,0,,

242,This is who I am and I am special no matter what.,0,,
243,"The children really seemed to enjoy creating a symbol of who they are, their own identity. It was a very moving experience to see them open up about themselves, how they felt inside and out.  Having them all share about themselves brought out a lot of self-esteem issues for the good.",0,,

253,Gluing this together is almost as hard as gluing your life together.,0,,
254,I especially like this one because it helped the children look ahead and yet at the same time see what was behind them.  I saw them be able to see goals for themselves.  Imagine!,0,,

259,I make me happy! ó Two-year-old boy.,0,,
260,I feel better about my situation.  This was a positive reinforcement to things I already knew but somewhere along the line forgot. Thank you for reminding me.,0,,

271,The art fills the room with peace: it acts as a drug-free stress reliever!,0,,
272,I felt very rewarding seeing how much fun the kids had with this and being able to tell that they were proud of their work.,0,,
274,I was able to forget my present feelings of overwhelming despair.  I was able to focus on future accomplishments.  After the rain there is always a blue sky and sunshine in the future.,0,,
275,"I realized I was finished with the past.  I didn't want to waste time with it, so it was so exciting to focus on the future!",0,,
276,It helped me a lot to start to take the first steps toward all that I want to change in my life.,0,,
277,"They enjoyed the class, and everyone seemed grateful and said it was nice to have a class like this and be able to express themselves in different ways.",0,,

279,"One of the women expressed that tears came down her cheeks during the meditation, but she understood them as happy tears.

280,"I had an old client who returned to windows after a one year absence, and she was so happy to see how her art has progressed from reflecting her feelings of hurt and crisis to now her feelings of safety and security.

281,"This project was very helpful for the women in group to see where they have been, where they are, and where they want to go. It was so powerful.",0,,
282,"One lady said this workshop gave her so much inspiration that she feels now she can do anything. She moved out of state after that and is going to pursue her career in art that she has always wanted. She had a suitcase full of paintings and oils with her. Not many clothes, but she had her art!

283,I witnessed one group participant who generally has difficulty focusing on feelings use the art to express her emotions about her experience.,0,,

286,It was the best day of my life!,0,,

But there is hope.í  This workshop led her to this powerful breakthrough.",0,,

981,"This workshop provided a good amount of direct DV education. The teaching component of signs of abusive relationships was very useful for our clients. Thinking about these signs as they may have been experienced, and then writing about and thinking about wants, needs, and boundaries for future relationships, and then transferring all this to the creation of the project, was an excellent way to take this knowledge about ""red flags"" and apply them to ones own personal experience.",0,,
329,The art helps women let down their walls; it helps them connect with each other in a way they donít in the groups that are just talking.  Itís easier for them to talk about their hurtful and painful experiences.  This leads them to develop empathy and understanding and connection with each other; it brings them closer.,0,,

350,"About 3  months ago I began to hang the women's art up in the shelter. A woman approached me and thanked me, she said, ëthank you for hanging my art up, I realize how important it is to the children, but also for me.

354,"I think the workshop makes you think about your past, present and future.  That's a deep process.  But here you can think freely and honestly.  You can be very honest with yourself.",0,,
355,"The most rewarding moment was when a client was able to identify hidden feelings, she was also able to open up and share those feelings and put a name on it. This facilitated a counseling session which was much needed. She was able to find herself in her current situation and find a goal in the future to work towards. Staff was then able to provide better support and encouragement during the rest of her stay.",0,,
356,"One woman drew a hand with a wedding ring w/ blood dripping down the hand from the ring; the hand holding a broken chain, she wrote her words on the front of the picture and then said,ínow that the picture is out of me it no longer has a hold on meí.",0,,

359,"A very shy lady, who hardly spoke and seemed sad most days approached me and said to me, ""All week long I look forward to the workshops, I guess because I relax and enjoy and have no negative thoughts.""",0,,
360,"When my dad used to tell me to grow up and stop crying like a baby, it hurt my heart. I still don't feel like it's safe to cry.",0,,
361,My monster makes sure that nobody touches me.  He protects me and keeps me safe from people.,0,,
362,I have learned about the cycle of violence. I do not want the monster to live inside of me I am going to do everything possible to destroy those feelings.,0,,
363,"At times I feel angry but I stop to remember what I have learned at the shelter and I want to use other ways to stop my anger, I do not want to hurt anyone.",0,,
364,A 12-year-old boy shared with us that the monster would come out in him when he used to bully children at school. When he did this workshop he started to cry and acknowledge that he did not want the monster to come out anymore. He wants to learn to help others and not hurt others.,0,,
365,She's lonely and just kind of floating around. Like me and my sister.,0,,
366,My monster destroys people's feelings.,0,,
367,I didn't know there were happy monsters I thought all monsters were bad.,0,,
368,"Not only did the moms' and kids' artworks help me understand them better, the activity fostered both nonverbal and verbal group communication.  This laid the foundation for stronger group cohesion.  It also helped me understand the dynamics between each mother and her child, as well as between moms and between kids.",0,,
369,"I used different colors because I feel all mixed up.  There is a box inside that the monster lives in.  Its dark and no bright colors can come inside.  Outside the box is happiness. I keep the lid on the box where the monster lives, I have to control these feelings.",0,,
370,I think my monster needs to be happy. He needs to be encouraged by this mother and cheered to not be shy. I really liked doing this.,0,,
371,"My monster says, ëMy family is cursed, but Iím not!í",0,,
372,"I thought back to when my dad was here, a lot of bad things happened, that's what I made this for.... My mom said everyone has a good and a bad side and this is the good side of my monster and this is the bad side.",0,,
373,The girls made monsters that looked like them.  Their monsters protected them from harm.  Their monsters protected them while they were asleep.,0,,
374,A 10-year-old child drew a picture of his monster underwater and said ëwhen I get angry I feel like I am underwater and I cannot breath.í,0,,
375,My monster is angry when he's not listened to.,0,,
376,The workshop created such an incredible means through which the participants were able to express their feelings and their current situation.,0,,
377,"Nothing is ugly, everything is pretty.  And remember nothing is wrong.",0,,
378,My painting is a example of the anger I feel inside like a dark hole.,0,,
379,I like this project because we all work together.,0,,
380,"We had a great closing discussion.  The children admitted to being angry about sharing their paper with another.  After, they saw the beauty of teamwork. The children learned to work together to make a ""masterpiece.""  I was very proud of the children!",0,,
381,"I really loved painting, I didn't feel sad at all, just happy...I loved how it felt to put the paint on the paper, just relaxing...can we paint an ocean or something next time?",0,,
382,When the leader asked children how they felt when someone else was drawing on their paper. The children shared that they were a little bit nervous at the beginning but they felt better and had fun later.,0,,
383,"We had a young boy that was always troubled and withdrawn.  During a workshop called Feeling Friends participants list all their feelings on slips of paper and place them in a paper doll figure theyíve decorated.  All the feelings expressed by the boy were those of anger.  It was very intense with things like ìI am not wanted,î ìI am teasedî and ìI have no friends.î  When asked about the angry feelings he broke down, cried and finally expressed everything he was holding in all year.  He hugged us and said that he didnít want to leave. He felt that the shelter was his home and he felt safe there.  The Feeling Friend helped him to sort out his feelings, fears and allowed us to finally feel like we connected!",0,,
384,It was very rewarding to give this small family an avenue to express feelings to one another. The dad often struggles in identifying and labeling feelings with one another. This exercise provided them with an avenue to have this discussion not only in the moment but at home too.,0,,
386,The most rewarding thing with this project was the acceptance and the recognition they all gave themselves about suppressing their feelings at times.,0,,
387,"We were doing this activity with a love theme for the month of February.  All the kids sat in a circle and we read the book ëWhat is Loveí.  After this we began to talk about all the aspects of love. What does love smell like? How is it shaped? What color is it?  All the kids shared.  One stated that love is black in color.  When the whole group had shared, we talked about the ideas.  I asked Joseph why love was black.  His response was very touching.  He said, ëLove is black--black is a color with a lot of depth, just like love.í  This allowed the group to talk about how common ideas and associations to colors and emotions are not always what we think.  It was talked about with great enthusiasm and helped engage the kids.  As Joseph stated, ëThe depth of the color black can mean much more than just darkness.í",0,,
388,"Her doll was with a red dress and white hearts. In her heart she wrote love, care, books, toys. She shared with the group. She said this is me. ëI love my family, I care about others, I like to read to others because that makes me happy to share my time with the ones I love.í",0,,
389,It is half male and half female to show how they can get along together without fighting.,0,,
390,"The kids really loved this project. They were so creative in expressing how they felt and who they cherished most in their lives. The end result was incredible. We created a display in our group room with the world and all the dolls around it. I had the children decorated flowers, hearts, rainbows, etc. It was great!",0,,
391,Love is when the mean boy at schools yells at me during recess and I don't yell back at him.,0,,
392,I show love by hugging and kissing my mom good night and telling her that I love her.,0,,
393,Love is when I make my mom's bed in the morning because she gets up early to go to work and she's too tired to do it herself.,0,,
394,Love is special and natural.,0,,
395,Love is great because you never run out. Love is best when the other person loves you back.,0,,

397,"If I let my feelings out, I won't have any feelings.",0,,
398,I feel I can speak my mind with my mask and no one will judge me because they can't see who I am.,0,,
399,My mask doesn't want to talk about what happened.,0,,
400,I want my mask to say I'm hopeful and kind.  That is who I want to be.,0,,
401,"The participants were really positive toward each other and i was amazed by their creations as were they, as well as how they applied their expressions of themselves to our conflict resolution puppet show.",0,,
402,"I was working with one child who had lots of aggression.  He really responded to the project.  We were doing the bag puppets project and he kept his hands very busy.  When he was done, he said his puppet was called ëHomie.í  He said ëHomie likes to slap people around.í  I asked him how he felt about that and he said, ëI donít like it.  Heís not MY role model.  Hitting is not the answer.í  As we talked more, he shared that when heís angry, he doesnít like to scream into a pillow to get it out.  He likes to get it out with markers and color.  It was great to get to talk about the issue of aggression with him and I could see that for him, the answer is all about the art.",0,,
403,What I enjoy most is how the art gives the children the opportunity to be children.,0,,
404,"Butterflies are me, many shades of freedom I feel today.",0,,
405,If my butterfly could fly anywhere it would be in the fresh air with her family where no one told her anything that made her scared.,0,,
406,"This butterfly is like me, it's slow at transforming, but it, and I, will get there.",0,,
407,"My butterfly is for my mom, because it started out blank and now it is full of beautiful color!",0,,
408,It was rewarding to see the children understand the idea about our life journeys and that we change and grow. They really grasped the idea and enjoyed the process. One little girl made hers into a necklace and she wears it every day.,0,,
409,"I look at my butterfly and imagine it flying high above the world, far away from violence.",0,,
410,"My butterfly will remind me to respect people, be nice, and treat them with care.",0,,
411,"A fifteen-year old made a butterfly for his mom, for everything. He said his butterfly is the symbol of freedom for his mom...",0,,
412,Pride-the kids were glowing about their creations.,0,,
413,I picked the squiggly one because I'm all over the place. The many colors are like my moods and the eyes are my watchdogs.,0,,
414,My journey was amazing.,0,,
415,"My future will have no fighting and my mom will not have to work hard, I will take care of her.",0,,
416,"If my butterfly could fly anywhere it would be all over the world, it's a good feeling to feel free and no one can control you.",0,,
417,"She told me she wrote words on her butterflies (5) that she has never heard from anyone. She said ëMy journey is to feel love, comfort, laughter, acceptance and beautiful.í",0,,
418,"A 10 year old girl wrote on her butterflies ""peace, love, share."" When she shared her butterflies with the group, she told us about how she wants her father to love her the same way as he loves her brother.",0,,
419,"A butterfly has to move sometimes and so do people.  We had to move because of my mom's boyfriend, but it's for the better.",0,,
420,"The Shrinky Dink Journey Butterfly workshop had a big impact on one child. When I told her this was for her, she said no one had ever given her anything before.  She was also happy to discover that she was not the only one that had been from place to place, like a butterfly.",0,,
421,"After the Debut CD project, one of the teen moms who had been very dependent on her boyfriend said, ëNever have a baby because you are lonely.í  This was a major moment of self-awareness for her.",0,,
422,I want to make one for each part of myself.,0,,
423,"The CD art activity was such a success! The girls were wonderfully challenged by the activity. It helped them consider their outward presentation and interior world, all in a hip and cool way. Not only did the activity invite the girls to see themselves in a more complex way, but it was a self-esteem booster, and a centering device. What kind of world will they create? What kind of person will they be? The CD art activity assumes each girl is a gift to the world-unique and beautiful and strong.",0,,
424,I'm going to give this shield to my baby sister when she is born so she knows I'll take care of her and wonít let anyone hurt her.,0,,
425,I protect my family because I don't want my family to be in danger.,0,,
426,"This workshop did wonders for the one 5 year old boy.  His mom was talking to him about his shield and what the pictures/words represented.  A picture of a woman statue, kneeling down, holding up the world was supposed to be her.  As he was telling her this he started to cry and so did his mom.  He saw his mom trying to carry the world on her shoulders for him and his sister.  This is coming from a boy who is outgoing, but very shy when you ask him what he is thinking or feeling.  As a leader this touched my heart.  Sometimes I get to be a part of hearing the children tell their moms about their art and sometimes I donít.  Knowing that leading the ìwindowsî really does reach these children makes my job all the more worth while.",0,,
427,I would protect my family because I love them.,0,,
428,"One boy who doesn't usually like to show his work or talk about it, got up to show his shield and talked about how he and his foster father had been designing a coat of arms before he was taken to another placement.",0,,
429,I have the love of my mom that will protect me.,0,,
430,"Having them realize that they need to & can protect themselves.  They don't just have to worry about other people.  One boy said, ""I chose myself because I protect myself from danger.""",0,,
431,"The protective shield gives you memories so if you're not with your family, you can think of them and not feel alone.",0,,
432,The moms and teens really discovered that they are stronger than they think. They also fully realized how their past has made them strong!,0,,
433,I am strong because of my brain!  I am strong because of my past!  I am strong because I am a girl!,0,,
434,We are strong because....,,,
\,,,,
"We can adjust to new situations...We can make new friends...We are funny,smart, and cool...We are brave...We love...We help people...We work hard...We are good at our video games...We have fun.",0,,,
435,I really liked this project because it gave me a chance to see what my strengths are and what I can expand upon.,0,,
436,"I am strong because...I act positively, I think of my family, I think positive, I have hope, I don't think of the past, I think of the future, I have faith.",0,,
437,"I am strong because I see other teens doing bad things and I choose not to. My mother was strong for leaving and coming to the shelter, that makes me strong too.",0,,
438,"I am strong because I am smart, I have good friends, I'm creative, I'm loved and I am a forgiver.",0,,
439,I am strong because I see that my mom is strong.  I am strong because I have lived a hard life.  I am strong because I came to the shelter.,0,,
440,"This is hard - I know I am strong, but I don't know where my strength comes from.",0,,
441,"I am strong because in spite of it all, I am still happy.",0,,
442,Can I take this home to show my mom all the good things about me?,0,,
443,All of the work was very beautiful. In fact we hung some of the work up and around the children's program. The kids also chose to take their art to their rooms to hang. I encourage this because it promotes pride in themselves and to use their art as a way of making their rooms more familiar and comfortable.,0,,
444,"Most of the children were enjoying themselves.  They were drawing ""happy pictures"" which helped them recollect ""happy memories"" of when they were home.  One boy just colored with dark colors and yet it seemed like he was at peace because he released some of his hidden emotions.",0,,
445,I am beautiful like a Maui sunset.,0,,
446,I feel happy in the shelter because I don't have to be afraid anymore.,0,,
447,"This was a great exercise in how children can be very different from one another--it helped them to appreciate one another's differences.  For example, when choosing what makes them ëshine,í some of the kids chose activities like running or playing soccer, while others chose more artistic activities like drawing or singing.  It showed that everyone has their own special gifts.",0,,
448,I really shine because the person that makes it possible is my mom. I feel good whenever I help my grandmother. Whenever I teach my brother something it makes me feel great.,0,,
449,"These are the things that make me shine: my smile, love, family, church, friends and my mother. I shine because of my mom, my education, my family, and because I feel I am strong.",0,,
450,My rays are coming out of my heart where it is warm and bright.,0,,
451,"The participant was able to begin focusing on himself rather than on his mom or dad,  and on his strengths rather than the difficulties he has been having.",0,,
452,"Hands are for loving, Hands are for creation, Hands are for playing.",0,,
453,The participants loved being able to think of all the ways they can help one another. One child said ëMy hands help others and that helps the world.í,0,,
454,We learned to respect others by using our hands in a loving way. We can be kind and show love to anyone. My dad has hurt my mom and his hands are mean and scary. He makes people and my mom cry.,0,,
455,This hand will hold me up so high to see all the bad and take it from people that hurt.,0,,
456,The most rewarding thing was to see the children be proud of the things they had done to help people in their lives.,0,,
457,"There is a nine-year-old girl at the shelter who was very verbal and expressed that people see her as weird and strange. But she also expressed that she knows she's not. She illustrated this by making the outside gray and scribbly and her inside bright and cheery. I love it when kids can overcome how and when others attempt to bring us down!  This child was always very hard on herself and on other people.  Doing this project made her very introspective. She discovered that she wasnít really like the way people saw her. She knows that she is not weird or strange.  Along with that, she discovered that other people didnít have the power to determine who she was or what she could do. SHE had the power to change all that. It was very helpful to her when dealing with the bad feelings about her father and how he had ruined all her family memories. She learned that she could create new memories and that she could be in control of the outcome.  She was able to apply these new discoveries when working on other workshops.",0,,
458,"We did the workshop Inside/Outside and the kids all felt like they were exploring themselves in a way they never had before and they revealed things they hadn't shared to others before.  They were surprised about what things they had to share and they discovered that it is okay to have secrets, it is okay to have private thoughts and it is okay to share those thoughts and secrets with people they feel safe with.",0,,
459,"I learned what feelings I have inside, sometimes good feelings and sometimes weird feelings. I didn't realize how many feelings I had.",0,,
460,"I liked that it gave me time to look inside and I got to draw. I found out that Iím not the only one that feels scared, lost and confused.",0,,
461,I like that I had to do a lot of thinking. I had something around me that didnít want me to let anyone love me.,0,,
462,"I like that that I got a chance to express myself, how I feel. I found out that Iím really tough by not showing the bad part of me.",0,,
463,I hide how I feel because I think no one will understand me or nothing will change.,0,,
464,My mother and father created the outside of me and now it is up to me to fulfill the inside of me.,0,,
465,This is the line of the shelter. We are in here. My dad and his friends are outside. They can't see us. They can't even get to us.,0,,
466,My mom is the big fish and she protects me from the shark.,0,,
467,"The treasure boxes expressed words of love, family, hope, faith and thank you's. I loved working with moms and their children. It brings the families closer and builds communication to heal from their emotional wounds.",0,,
468,"The stones are safe in the Treasure boxes, just like mom keeps us safe here in the shelter.",0,,
469,Each color in my box represents a member of my family. I want to keep them safe inside my box.,0,,
470,This treasure box is about friendship.  This color represents happiness.,0,,

473,I made this lion to protect me and my mom.,0,,
474,A six-year old talked about wanting to be able to fly away.  She would fly away when dad would fight with mom.,0,,
475,I want to be a snake because they shed their skin.,0,,
476,I wish mommy had an animal to protect her too - I will share mine.,0,,
477,I think I would like to have a dog someday so he can protect me and I can love him.,0,,
478,"We did the ëCreating a Safe Placeí workshop where the kids do a crayon/watercolor representation of a place they feel safe in or a person they feel safe with.  One of the girls drew a castle with me on the outside.  She said, ëMy family is in there and you are protecting us.í",,,
\,,,,
,,,,
\,,,,
"At first the oldest boy couldnít think of any place he felt safe or anyone he felt safe with.  I told him he could make up a place heíd like to have.  He drew the house he hoped to have one day with his family, and then drew a man with his arms wide open.  He said, ëI donít know who he is, but his arms are open and he is waiting for me and will keep me safe.í",,,,
\,,,,
,,,,
\,,,,
This is the first time these children have ever had a safe place.  Itís amazing what the art can do - so much more than words.  Thank you so much for giving these wonderful children a voice!,0,,,

482,"I feel safe because I have food to eat, I have things to drink and I have a bed to lay on, thatís why I feel safe.",0,,
483,"It is so rewarding to be a part of this process and be able to create a safe, structured, nonjudgmental environment for the children to express themselves with their art and their stories.",0,,
484,"In the group, there are two siblings who love to spend time together. When I explained the project, they both looked at each other and smiled. When group was over, they explained that their safe place was where brothers and sisters could play together.",0,,
485,"I guess for me, my safe place is anywhere my mom is. She has always protected us and I feel safe with her, no matter where I'm at.",0,,
486,"This is a shelter. I drew my mom, brother, sister and me. There are a lot of windows so I can see that no one came near to the shelter that might bother us. I feel safe because my dad can not find us.",0,,
487,It's rewarding to give them a respite for even a little while. To give them their safe haven.,0,,
488,My safe place was at my Grandma and Grandpaís house.  No one would hurt me there.,0,,
489,My safe place is inside of me and I can open the door or close it.,0,,
490,"We saw a big improvement with a 10 year old boy. He came in full of anger and not willing to cooperate. He thought everything was ëstupidí and threw us a lot of attitude.  Every day was a mission - reassuring him each day was our goal. With positive workshops, patience and love, we saw him change his low self-esteem to a positive self-image.  During the ëCreating a Safe Placeí workshop, he shared a lot with me about things that happened around his home.  His home was not a safe place and that workshop gave him a way to share about the things he had been through.  He smiles more now and before he left the shelter, he told us the the art groups were the ones that helped him release what he needed to release.",0,,
491,The participant began sharing some of the images she was choosing and was relating them to the discussions we have been having. She's been opening up more and more each appointment.  This appointment she expressed feeling comfortable and having an interest in participating in the group i had mentioned to her during a prior appointment.,0,,
492,"My tunnel represents my new life...It is starting. It has bright colors because my life is also bright, it has delicious food and ice cream because my life is also delicious, it has a parking lot with unique cars because my life is also unique.  What I am really trying to show is: how special my life is and I am feeling happy because I am realizing that I am starting more to forget about the past and I am looking ahead for a better life in the future.",0,,
493,"This is my path with the important things for me: lots of love, friends, be self-confident, be cool, be able to share emotion.",0,,
494,"This is the world I escaped from: my dad abused me since I was a child, my dad drinks a lot. He was never there for us. This is my mom: she cried a lot. Here is my sister and me: we are happy, far from dad and his fights. This is me in the past: I felt always sad. I saw so many people sad, crying. This is me now: I'm planning to be a writer or an actress. This is me in the future: in my house. I will be famous.",0,,
495,My heart is like this tunnel book.  Thereís all kinds of stuff in it but the bad stuff will get smaller.,0,,
496,I especially like this one because it helped the children look ahead and yet at the same time see what was behind them.  I saw them being able to see goals for themselves.  Imagine!,0,,

498,I want to have a happy family someday.,0,,

500,I want a house for my momma. She deserves it.,0,,

502,My wish for the past is that my mom and dad would have never started fighting. My wish for the future is that when my dad comes back he is changed and will not yell at my mom and me.,0,,

His mom was really impressed that an art project could be so powerful! It was a great moment.",0,,,

She and her daughter were survivors of Hurricane Katrina.  They managed to make it through this natural disaster, and now are trying to live through this man made disaster of domestic violence.  Her clock is broken to pieces, yet she had noticed all of the blessings she has been given.  This participant is extremely positive during such a hard time.

582,"There was a mom in one of our groups who felt that her three year old son didnít care about her or have any interest in her.  She did a tunnel book at one of our Windows groups and afterwards when she brought it home with her her son asked her ìwhat is this?î  She told him, ìItís a book about me.î  He then asked her to ìreadî it to him, and she told him stories about herself by looking at the images on each layer.  Now he asks her to take it out every night to ìreadî to him.  The little boy thinks it is a story book about his mom. It has connected them and brought them closer.  The woman now feels that her son cares about her, and because of this she feels the change also in herself towards her son.  It has made such a difference in their relationship.",0,,

587,"Participants negotiated for one more session to complete their tunnel books.  They showed a high degree of commitment to this project.  One participant benefitted from struggling with dissatisfaction over the impact of choosing to put her negative past on the first frame.  She took her book apart and started again.  She was very happy with her revised book which put her present first, past second and future third.  It was very powerful.  I'm glad we were able to give her the time to work with her book until she was happy with it.  The two other participants were inspired by this woman's determination to persevere until she got something that felt right to her. She remarked, ""It made me think a lot about how I'm trying to change my past and what I want my future to feel like.""",0,,
588,I know better who I am and where I am going after doing this. I accept myself more.,0,,

592,"One of the women expressed that tears came down her cheeks during the meditation, but she understood them as happy tears.  Another woman got very emotional while reading her harmony piece and while showing us her footprint collage.  She said it made it very real about where she came from and where she wants to go.",0,,
593,This workshop made me have faith in life.  I can make it through the storms.  It helped me to express my thoughts in front of my face.,0,,

595,"They now see they have worth, purpose in life.",0,,

597,"I want to be a self-assured, strong woman, and I want my children to have opportunities and to be free of domestic violence.",0,,
598,Itís good to get thoughts out of your head.  Itís different than saying the words and thinking about it. It feels good to get it out through my hands.,0,,
599,"When we all share our experience (past, present, and presently making our art), it's incredibly healing.",0,,
600,"Journey Footprints is a reminder to myself to feel empowered and proud to have been through the journey and have risen from the ashes to become anew, with a sense of loving life in its truthfulness and its freedom!",0,,
601,This helped me see that I do have a future...and I didn't think I did.,0,,
602,"I really needed to be here. I was feeling down, but now I have a little more focus and feel that my spirits are uplifted.",0,,
603,"A client participated with her son. She seemed to get to know her son better through the art project. This family has been shelter hopping, and hasn't had the time to do something fun with her son in quite some time. It was really rewarding to get to see them take sometime for themselves to just be mother and son in a relaxed environment.",0,,
604,I want to remember I am not alone in what happened to me.,0,,

608,"This is about a new life, scary and foreign, but something I treasure.",0,,
609,I liked the workshop because it allowed me to think of something other than my abuser.,0,,
610,This workshop helped me to find words that will uplift me when I am feeling down. In order to free ourselves from violence we have to find out what causes us to stay in certain relationships and run from others.,0,,
611,"I just lost my kids, and spending this time working on my treasure box helped me put order to my thoughts.",0,,
612,"This was a great workshop, because I've been so busy trying to just survive, I forgot my goals and things I wanted to do. This helped me realize I can do more, and there's so much more of life to live.",0,,
613,This is going to be for my daughter. I want her to know I was thinking about her when I made this. It is so special.,0,,
614,"The art workshop made me take a look at myself, and talk to myself, and encourage myself.  It was uplifting and empowering.",0,,
615,I was able to express myself through colors and decorating. Nobody was around to put me down or say my project was ugly. Iím satisfied with myself for the first time in four years.,0,,
616,The ìWhat Makes Me Shineî exercise literally made all the members shine by the end of the night.  Very powerful and healing.  I am honored to spread the ìAWBWî light. A newcomer was showered in love and acceptance!,0,,
617,"My client has very low self-esteem so I thought this project would be a good choice for her. When I initially described the project she told me that there wasnít anything she liked about herself.  I didnít want to put words in her mouth I suggested some things that I thought might help.  She ended up putting things about each of her children and things she likes to do and ultimately a few things she likes about herself.  In the middle of her sun she wrote a beautiful, heart-like poem.  She told me she felt relaxed and had fun while she worked.  I was so pleased with the effort she made.",0,,
618,"One thing I really like about this program is that it helps me explore the underlying feelings that I would not normally express.  Maybe itís the unconscious, but I get to dig deep and go underneath it all.",0,,
619,My personal needs flower talks about how much I love my kids and how I love to cook their favorite foods.  It also says I need a house to live in with my kids and a job to provide for them.,0,,
620,Windows continues to motivate me to taking more steps away from domestic violence.  This specific project helped me to realize my needs are important too.,0,,
621,I thought this project was very helpful to me because I realized that I am not alone in this room.  And I was being very selfish and self -centered in thinking my situation was unique. I feel that this made my mind feel a little more soothing than it normally is considering all that I am going through. I think it was fun and wonderful to get to the real me.  IT WAS COOL TO EXPRESS MYSELF.,0,,
622,Wow I didn't realize how hard it would be to know what it is I really need.,0,,
623,"I felt glad after doing this project because it made me realize that I have to work on my family communication.  Since my son was exposed to his father's abusive behavior, he sometimes acts like that. I have to be patient when correcting his misbehaviors and be strict with the discipline. I know I will accomplish that because I love my son so much; he's the reason for my life.",0,,
624,"This activity is really good for women to think about their needs. It seems everybody has a need, but there is no chance to address or deeply think about the needs they have.",0,,
625,"After doing this project, I feel I'm starting from ground zero: I'm recovering my calm, my mental health.  Iím in better condition to help my children, who I need to see smiling, and who do smile now that we are safe from the batterer. With the support Iíve received, I feel liberated and confident, ready to achieve my goals: to provide a peaceful and loving home in which my children can grow up healthy.",0,,
626,"Using no tools to form shapes except for my hands was empowering for me. Somehow, it made me feel like I am enough.",0,,
627,This workshop always helps me to deal with my feelings about domestic violence and gives me the courage to get through it.,0,,
628,Thank you for helping me reach my feelings that were hidden for so long.  For the first time in my life I am relaxed. You donít even know how much Iím thankful for that.,0,,
629,"Thank you very much for the support that this program has given me, it is a beautiful way to express my sentiments through art. I feel great with this opportunity.",0,,
630,The most rewarding moment was when a client was able to identify hidden feelings. She was also able to open up and share those feelings and put a name on it. This facilitated a counseling session which was much needed. She was able to find herself in her current situation and find a goal in the future to work towards. Staff was then able to provide better support and encouragement during the rest of her stay.,0,,
631,"The women really enjoyed this activity.  Many of them used the same quote on their painting which was ""Every end is a new beginning.""  That is where many of the women are at with their emotions right now.  They feel like they are in transition and to paint and reflect gave them encouragement that the feeling they have is normal; everyone in the group feels the same, so it's OK to feel that way.",0,,
632,I feel the workshop has helped me significantly with a lot of my self-esteem issues.  It has also helped me with feeling comfortable in my own skin.,0,,
633,They enjoyed seeing where they have been and where they are in life now and what their future will hopefully be like.,0,,
634,These sessions help me express how I can deal with these feelings that I'm holding inside. I really need not to hold in so much. I know it is not healthy and the art really releases pressure and eases stress.,0,,
635,One client has been very confused and during this project she was able to clearly express her road to self love.,0,,
636,"Clients said that they realize that they are not loving themselves enough. After this workshop, they knew, so they said that they will practice it in the future.",0,,
637,"One individual completed this project when she first came to the shelter and now, having done it again, sheís amazed at the difference.  The first map featured external goals, while the second one showed more internal objects, things of self love: ëI can't believe how much my priorities and I have changed in such a short time...í",0,,
638,"One woman's map kept leading her back to her batterer until she was finally able to ëbreak away,í and that seemed to impact the group. It showed that it is not a linear process nor an easy one but that in the end, the client still attained her goal of separation and end of the abuse.",0,,
639,"This is always a good workshop. It makes the women voice their needs, which a lot of them haven't done in years or don't know how to do.  This makes it easy for them. Thank you.",0,,
640,I didn't realize how important it is to take time for me. I didn't know I was coming up with justifications for being good to myself. This workshop was great; I feel really relaxed and good.,0,,
641,One of the participants stated that she liked how the butterfly shriveled up and turned from one side to another like if it was struggling and then at the end it unraveled and came to peace. She stated that this reminded her of herself. I thought that was a great analogy.,0,,
642,One woman that I did the Shrinky Dink project with loved it so much that she went home and bought large sheets of it to do with her kids.  She came back so excited and with tons to show me!  They loved it!,0,,
643,"One woman had been in a very abusive relationship for ten years.  We did the shrinky dinks workshop and she created two butterflies and made them into earrings.  They represented her two daughters.  She said they were free and could fly anywhere.  That workshop was such an amazing transformation for her.  It woke her up from that treacherous life.  The next day she came down with her earrings on and she looked completely different.  She had her hair down and wore bright colors instead of the black she had been limited to.  She looked completely different after that workshop.  And when she went out, people asked her where she got her earrings.  She was so proud and felt powerful doing that for herself.",0,,
644,"I liked being able to express myself about issues and feelings that I have, that I can't communicate to people.",0,,
645,"I think the workshop makes you think about your past, present and future.  That's a deep process.  But here you can think freely and honestly.  You can be very honest with yourself.",0,,
646,"This period of time brought flashbacks of their abusive experiences. Although it took them to a place of trauma, they seemed to have a better sense of self.  They were able to identify the role they took in the relationship and compared them to their role in their current and/or future relationships. ìWow, I can't believe I let him do that to me. I was able to identify with all the information provided.î",0,,
647,"This workshop helped me see all of the abuse I experienced, and to help me discover myself little by little.",0,,
648,"When I say aloud how abuse affected me, what he did, it makes it more real. And now I have to and will deal with it.",0,,
649,"Even though the pain was tremendous when going through this workshop, it was wonderfully informative.  I learned that I am not alone and there are behaviors that I never even considered abuse!",0,,
650,"You can read books and pamphlets, but I think with my hands making things. It works to wake up a part of me that was dead.",0,,
651,We don't have to put up with the abuse.  We are going forward.,0,,
652,"Some of the women wanted to believe they were ""over"" the power and control issues in their lives.  Extreme emotion was brought to the forefront.",0,,
653,This workshop has helped me show all the abuse I was in and will help me to recognize it in the future.  It has also helped me discover myself little by little.,0,,
654,I learned how to stand on my own and what to look for in a healthy relationship. I'm learning how to live on my own and find myself.,0,,
655,It helped me to keep reinforcing the thought of turning my husband away.,0,,
656,"After doing the ìFuneral of ëI Cantísî my client was finally ready to leave the abusive relationship and got a restraining order.  She kept telling me that I did this for her and I told her ëNo, it isnít me. It is you that did it.  It is this program that did it!í",1,,
657,"This was a very emotional workshop.  It was wonderful to see each woman stand in front of the group and share her ""I cantís"" and then have the others walk over to her, embrace her and reassure her that she ""can"" do whatever she sets her mind to.  The looks on their faces when they put that piece of paper through the shredder was priceless.  I saw confidence in their eyes when they turned and looked at me.  I loved doing this workshop with them because of the impact it had on each of them.",0,,
658,"I felt peace, relief, and good.",0,,
659,Very powerful workshop. The women were very honest and released a lot of fear and pain.,0,,
660,"I burned my ""I can't"" on the ocean so if the ashes ever come back, they would do good things, not harm, since ash is good for the soil.",0,,
661,"Visualizing and then burning their internal obstacles to happiness allowed many women in the program  to share their experiences, feelings and emotions for the first time.  One was inspired to verse:",,,

671,[It affected me] in a good way & bad. It allowed me to express everything I've been reminded of about who I am. It was easy because I've accepted who I am. Everyday I'm someone new.,0,,
673,"I facilitated the group Inside/Outside and had a group of five women.  One of the women made her piece of paper into a layered house, and as she unfolded the house, she ìcame outî as a battered lesbian.  Her comments were that she has never done that in a group of strangers before but felt so safe and comfortable that she felt she couldóit was a very warm and loving group with lots of support and insight.",0,,
674,"One woman shared in her comments that ìThis is one of the best things I have ever done for myself... The first day here you had me draw a tree.  To tell you the truth I didnít even understand why a tree!  But after we went on and with all the classes I got it, with all the art you had us do it turns out I really understand about all the hurt Iíve been through.î... The tree became a powerful metaphor for her.  She saw the tree and trunk as her entire being.  She realized that she was a tree, either healthy or not.  That she wanted a firm trunk to protect her kids, that she needed strong roots to be her feet.",0,,
675,"One of the women in the group painted a broken stick instead of a tree.  She had been ëgivení to a man at age 12, had been abused by him and had never discussed it until this workshop.

But there is hope.í  This workshop led her to this powerful breakthrough.",0,,

When the whole group had shared, we talked about the ideas.  I asked Joseph why love was black.  His response was very touching.  He said, ëLove is black--black is a color with a lot of depth, just like love.í  This allowed the group to talk about how common ideas and associations to colors and emotions are not always what we think.

Once he had the water in place he carefully placed the penguins in an arch across his paper as if they were jumping out of the water from the base of his paper.

His mother was so amused by his patience and efforts that all she could do was smile and watch while he worked. She looked on with a great deal of love.

916,"AWBW taught me how to integrate art into the services I provide and I am constantly reminded of the great value of utilizing art to help children heal.  I am working with a seven-year-old girl who has severe conduct issues that have caused her to have problems in many environments including school. The girlís mother is a drug addict who has worked hard to change. Her mother has been drug free for three years and is trying to repair the damage that was done during her addiction.  The girl was unable to express herself and whenever she became angry she would refuse to talk or even move. The girl struggles to talk about her feelings because she does not want others to disapprove.  After I brought out the Rapping Puppets for the girl to play with she was able to open up and express different emotions.  The puppets revealed a whole other side to the girl, a very angry side that she had previously kept hidden.  She is now talking and we continue to explore her expression of anger with the art because she finds it easier to communicate that way.",0,,
917,"The vast majority of the children I work with are Asian Pacific Islanders.  Culturally, it is not common for women to express themselves verbally, thus their children perpetuate the tradition of silence. Art is a great way to break the ice and act as a conversation piece with the children, despite the ever present language barriers.  When a child experiences something traumatic or is faced with a conflict they cannot verbalize, we help them create A Book About Me.  I was able to witness the wonders this little exercise could do during my first week at APWC. During one of the workshops, a young girl (age 4) at the shelter hurt her foot badly and was inconsolable in her tears.  She seemed to be in shock and was not verbally responding to any questions from the adults. No one knew how the incident occurred. At this time one of the staff members took her to a quieter room where the child could relax a little, and then they began to create a A Book About Me.  Her book was entitled ""When I Hurt My Left Foot"".  Through simple drawings illustrating what had happened and simple words (with help from our staff) to accompany each picture, the girl was able to describe her experience in a non-threatening, non-judgmental way. The child became more and more comfortable as the book progressed and opened up more easily as her feelings and situation were acknowledged and validated.  As adults, we want to provide the children with an environment they feel is safe and trusting enough to express themselves. I see firsthand how these children take great pride in their books, and I believe it to be a very effective tool in showing them how to convey emotions and communicate situations they cannot verbalize. The exercise is so simple, yet powerful. It's flexibility allows it to be used for practically any situation. You can think of it as an ""open book"" to your feelings.",0,,
918,"A group of girls were busy using glitter pens on their This Is Me project when a boy walked up and asked, ëcan boys do art too?í  I immediately got him set up with art supplies and he went wild with the glitter pens.

The art enabled the children to look past gender stereotypes.",0,,

920,"The art workshops not only take care of our clients but our staff as well.  Due to the economy our staff was told to prepare for some layoffs.  No one ended up getting laid off, but the possibility of it happening was very traumatic for the staff.  I facilitated the A Journey Within workshop with the staff, which was very effective with helping the staff heal.  Now every time we need a brake from all of the stress we experience at work, we all gather together and light our candle.",0,,
921,"Art is a great tool to utilize when working with victims of sexual assault.  One of my clients had a difficult time identifying positive things about herself.  She was first abused at the age of twelve and the abuse continued through out her life.  The client focused on all of the bad things she had done in her life, and felt that her actions caused the abuse.  The client never dressed up because she didnít feel like she deserved to be beautiful.  Much to my surprise when the client created a What Makes Me Shine project she was able to identify so many things that made her ëshineí that she filled all of the rays of her sun with positive characteristics.  When the client arrived for her next session she was transformed, and was wearing a beautiful matching outfit and purse.  The art was the one therapeutic activity that allowed my client to see her beauty.  Both she and I are grateful for the gifts AWBW has given us.",0,,

923,"A nine-year-old boy and his seven-year-old sister entered our shelter with their mother.   The children consistently attended the AWBW art group and when it came time for them to speak about their projects they would politely decline.  Time after time I would ask them to share and they would reply, ëno thatís ok.í  Both of them really responded to the Letter To Fatherís workshop and wrote heartfelt letters and even decorated the envelopes. I was so surprised that when it came time for the children to talk about what they created they were the first to volunteer.  As they read their letters the two of them shook and cried.  I felt like a proud mother that day, as the siblings were able to open up a part of themselves that was previously hidden.",0,,
924,"Art is a fantastic tool for empowerment.  I had a client who I affectionately referred to as ëtemplate girl,í because every time we did a project she asked for a template.  I purposely ran the Watercolor Windows workshop because it doesnít have a template.  Much to my surprise she did not even ask for a template.  At the end of the workshop I said, ëthis is the first time that you have not asked for a template.í  The client responded by giving me a beaming smile, which reminded me why the work I do is so important.",0,,
925,"One of my clients, a nine-year-old girl, was understandably afraid of and has a lot of anger towards her abusive father.  One of her concerns was visits with her father.  She refused to visit, even when monitored, because she was afraid her father would get angry and she felt her father wouldnít listen to her.  She did agree to participate in family counseling with her father, aside from her own counseling, in hopes of healing and reconciliation.  During one of her individual sessions she participated in the Cheering Frog Flags workshop.  She happily made her flags, all of which were beautifully decorated; except for one flag that was left completely blank.  She described every flag, explaining who it represented and the positive things the person says to her. When I asked her why that she left one flag blank she was quiet for a moment and then replied, ë I made it for my dad because someday he will say something nice to me.í  After uttering this, her eyes welled with tears and I comforted her.  Then she looked at me and asked, ëcan you do me a favor and keep this until my dad says something nice I can put on the flag.í  Even though she was not able to complete a flag about her father the art gave her an opportunity to not only reflect on all of the ways other people have supported or cheered her on but gave her hope that her father might be one of those in the future.",0,,
926,"The workshop ""My Road"" was rewarding because the workshop allowed the participants to find a peaceful place where they would like to be in the future.

When presenting her project the woman began to cry, and was able to talk about a part of her being incomplete.  I was so happy she participated in the workshop, because she rarely does.

995,"ëAngelaí is a five year-old girl who entered our Outreach program after her mother left her abusive husband.  Angela had constantly seen verbal arguments in the home, and had heard her father threaten her mother on multiple occasions.  As her mother was preparing to leave the home, Angelaís father punched her mother in the face, and then went to his car and got a gun, which he waved around in front of the family.   ",,,
\,,,,
0,,,,
\,,,,
"Since then, Angela has had difficulty coping with the trauma, and had begun to cut her arms in an attempt to alleviate her pain.  She had also told her mother that she wished she was dead.  Angela also appeared to suffer from such debilitating anxiety, that she was afraid to have her mother leave the room during counseling sessions, and needed to have the door open at all times.  Along with helping the family seek therapeutic services, I worked with Angela to help her build coping skills.  The best way to help Angela turned out to be via art as she is too young and too deeply traumatized to be able to verbalize her fears.  ",,,,
\,,,,
0,,,,
\,,,,
"During a recent session, I decided to use the Aggressive Crayon warm up, as Angela had difficulty understanding what to do when she was angry, and tended to turn it into anxiety.  At first she was reluctant to show anger, even on a piece of paper.  As I showed her how I could ëbe angry,í she began to dig her crayons into the paper and scribble furiously.  As we both pressed down on our papers as hard as we could, her face began to relax; we kept going until she was out of breath, and we were both laughing.  Not only was this warm up a clear way for Angela to understand ëanger,í it was also a safe place for her to leave it, freeing her to experiencing a release.",,,,
\,,,,
,,,,
\,,,,
"In the days and weeks after the warm-up Angela has shown improvement.  She lets me shut the door now during sessions, and her hyper vigilance appears to have decreased.  While still anxious, Angela is able to manage her fears better and engage with other children and she is now in therapy at a local mental health agency.  ",,,,
\,,,,
0,,,,
\,,,,
"As her mother has also been getting support at Emerge, and we have been talking to her about how to help her children get through this, mom has reported that Angela has not cut in a while.  Part of this, I believe, is due to Angela not seeing her mother crying as much at home, and Angela feeling like she is living in a safe place.  ",,,,
\,,,,
0,,,,
\,,,,
"Obviously, the road for her will be a long one, but there has certainly been improvement, and the art has been extremely helpful to her.  Angela has been coming less frequently in the last several weeks, but I see this as a good sign as previously she had been asking for me constantly, which worried me.  I didnít want Angela to feel like Iím the only safe adult in their life, but have an entire network instead.  ",,,,

While I intend to simply create an example, the art always finds a way of digging into my psyche, so that I can finish and see EXACTLY where I am mentally on any given day.

She has suffered direct abuse from her father, along with witnessing some very traumatic incidents in the home.  She has become verbally abusive to her sisters and mother, and has begun hitting walls.  Breathing, time outs, and journaling have been slightly effective, but we'd been running low on tools that allow her to express anger in a safe way.  At first Ana was unsure about the exercise and thought it was silly.  But the harder she scribbled, the more she enjoyed herself.  She at times broke the crayons, and looked at me as if she'd done something horribly wrong.  I assured her it was fine and even broke one myself.  The act of this seemed to liberate her to really dig in with the crayons.  At the end of the workshop, she commented, ëI think this will work.  I'm actually going to try this at home this week!",0,,

1092,"The majority of the children I work with have difficulty getting in touch with their feelings, and see anger as 'bad', or something they are perhaps not allowed to feel.
